Definition
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, most often based on blockchain technology.
##  What Is Cryptocurrency? 
A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. 
A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. 
### Key Takeaways
  * A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.
  * Some experts believe blockchain and related technologies will disrupt many industries, including finance and law.
  * The advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers and decentralized systems that do not collapse at a single point of failure.
  * The disadvantages of cryptocurrencies include their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining activities, and use in criminal activities.

##  Understanding Cryptocurrency 
Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions. 
Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name indicates, a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks of information on an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently verified by each validator on a network. 
Every new block generated must be verified before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by a network of individual nodes, or computers that maintain the ledger.1
Experts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, supply chains, and processes such as online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. ([JPM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=jpm>)) are using blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing.2
##  Types of Cryptocurrency 
Many cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, [Ethereum's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp>) ether was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether (ETH) inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism.3 The XRP Ledger Foundation's XRP is designed for financial institutions to facilitate transfers between different geographies.4
Because there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market, [it's important to understand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/crypto-investment-mistake-6504260>) the types. Knowing whether the coin you're looking at has a purpose can help you decide [whether it is worth investing in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/investing-in-crypto-6502543>)—a cryptocurrency with a purpose is likely to be less risky than one that doesn't have a use. 
Most of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coin's name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types you'll find with some of the names of tokens in that category: 
  * **Utility** : XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains.
  * **Transactional** : Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these.5
  * **Governance** : These tokens represent voting or other rights on a blockchain, such as Uniswap.6
  * **Platform** : These tokens support applications built to use a blockchain, such as Solana.7
  * **Security tokens** : Tokens representing ownership of an asset, such as a stock that has been tokenized (value transferred to the blockchain). MS Token is an example of a securitized token. If you can find one of these for sale, you can gain partial ownership of the Millennium Sapphire.8


If you find a cryptocurrency that doesn't fall into one of these categories, you've found a new category or something that needs to be investigated to be sure it's legitimate. 
##  How to Buy Cryptocurrency 
If you want to use cryptocurrency to buy products and services, you will need to visit a [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/crypto-exchanges-5272125>). These are businesses that allow you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies from other users at the current market price, similar to a stock. After buying the coins, you will need to transfer them to a digital wallet or use a third-party service like [Coinbase](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/coinbase-what-it-and-how-do-you-use-it/>) to store your coins. 
If you only want to buy cryptocurrency as an investment, you may be able to do so [through your brokerage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/the-best-online-brokers-for-crypto-trading-8765274>). For example, Robinhood allows users to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, although you cannot withdraw them from the platform for purchases. In addition, there are several crypto ETFs that provide exposure to the crypto asset class without requiring the investors to maintain their own wallets. For instance, as of May 2024, investors may choose to hold [Bitcoin futures ETF](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/investing/bitcoin-etfs-explained/>) shares. The SEC has also approved the listing and trading of Ether spot shares.9
##  Is Cryptocurrency Legal? 
[Fiat currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp>) derive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. For example, the U.S. dollar is recognized and issued by the government as the official currency of the United States and is "legal tender." 
But cryptocurrencies are not issued by any public or private entities. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their [legal status in different financial jurisdictions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121515/bitcoin-legal-us.asp>) throughout the world. It doesn't help matters that cryptocurrencies have primarily functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure. 
###  In the U.S. 
The legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, the [Financial Action Task Force (FATF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-action-task-force-fatf.asp>) recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance.10
Although cryptocurrencies are considered a form of money, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats them as financial assets or property for tax purposes. And, as with most other investments, if you reap capital gains selling or trading cryptocurrencies, the government wants a piece of the profits. How exactly the IRS taxes digital assets—either as capital gains or ordinary income—depends on how long the taxpayer held the cryptocurrency and how they used it.11
In the United States in July 2023, courts ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered securities when purchased by institutional buyers but not by retail investors purchased on exchanges.12
Enthusiasts called it a victory for crypto; however, crypto exchanges are regulated by the SEC, as are coin offerings or sales to institutional investors. So, crypto is legal in the U.S., but regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry. 
As of June 2024, [El Salvador](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/el-salvador-accepts-bitcoin-as-legal-tender-5200470>) is the only country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender for monetary transactions.13 In the rest of the world, [cryptocurrency regulation varies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/cryptocurrency-regulations-around-the-world-5202122>) by jurisdiction.
###  In Asia 
Japan's Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin as legal property. Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country are required to collect information about the customer and details relating to the wire transfer.14
China has [banned cryptocurrency exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-price-tumbles-as-chinese-notices-roil-market-5202739>), transactions, and mining within its borders, but has a [Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp>).15
India was reported to be formulating a framework for cryptocurrencies, but until it is enacted, crypto is not yet illegal. Exchanges are free to offer cryptocurrencies.16
###  In Europe 
Cryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union. Derivatives and other products that use cryptocurrencies must qualify as "financial instruments." In June 2023, the European Commission's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation went into effect. This law sets safeguards and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies.17
##  Is Cryptocurrency a Safe Investment? 
Cryptocurrencies have attracted a [reputation as unstable investments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/question-why-should-anyone-invest-crypto/>) due to high investor losses from scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure, [the technical complexity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/analyze-crypto-6456223>) of using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users. 
In addition to the [market risks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketrisk.asp>) associated with speculative assets, cryptocurrency investors should be aware of the following risks: 
  * **User risk** : Unlike traditional finance, there is no way to reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent. By some estimates, about one-fifth of all bitcoins are now inaccessible due to lost passwords or incorrect sending addresses.18
  * **Regulatory risks** : The regulatory status of some cryptocurrencies is still unclear in many areas, with some governments seeking to regulate them as securities, currencies, or both. A sudden regulatory crackdown could make it challenging to sell cryptocurrencies or cause a market-wide price drop.
  * **Counterparty risks** :Many investors and merchants rely on exchanges or other custodians to store their cryptocurrency. Theft or loss by one of these third parties could result in losing one's entire investment.
  * **Management risks** : Due to the lack of coherent regulations, there are few protections against deceptive or unethical management practices. Many investors have lost large sums to management teams that failed to deliver a product.
  * **Programming risks** :Many investment and lending platforms use automated smart contracts to control the movement of user deposits. An investor using one of these platforms assumes the risk that a bug or exploit in these programs could cause them to lose their investment.
  * **Market Manipulation** :Market manipulation remains a substantial problem in cryptocurrency, with influential people, organizations, and exchanges acting unethically.


Despite these risks, cryptocurrencies have seen a significant price leap, with the total market capitalization rising to about $2.4 trillion.19 Despite the asset's speculative nature, some have created substantial fortunes by taking on the risk of investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies. 
##  Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency 
Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation. 
Advantages
  * Removes single points of failure
  * Easier to transfer funds between parties
  * Removes third parties
  * Can be used to generate returns
  * Remittances are streamlined


Disadvantages
  * Transactions are pseudonymous
  * Pseudonymity allows for criminal uses
  * Have become highly centralized
  * Expensive to participate in a network and earn
  * Off-chain security issues
  * Prices are very volatile


###  Advantages Explained 
Cryptocurrencies represent [a new, decentralized paradigm for money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/question-why-should-anyone-invest-crypto/>). In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure—such as a large financial institution setting off a cascade of global crises, such as the one triggered in 2008 by the failure of large investment banks in the U.S. 
Cryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralized [transfers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transfer.asp>) are secured by the use of [public keys](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-key.asp>) and [private keys](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp>) and different forms of incentive systems, such as [proof of work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp>) or [proof of stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp>). 
Because they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties can be faster than standard money transfers. Flash loans in [decentralized finance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835>) are an excellent example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without requiring collateral, can be executed within seconds and are mostly used in trading. 
The [remittance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/r/remittance.asp>) economy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin [serve as intermediate currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/bitcoins-best-use-isnt-currency-its-overseas-remittances/>) to streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders, and subsequently converted to the destination fiat currency without third-party involvement. 
###  Disadvantages Explained 
Though they [claim to be an anonymous form of transaction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/top-bitcoin-myths/>), cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can follow. This opens up the possibility for governments, authorities, and others to track financial transactions. 
Cryptocurrencies have become a popular tool with criminals for nefarious activities such as money laundering and illicit purchases. The case of [Dread Pirate Roberts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/ross-ulbricht-dark-net-pirate/>), who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known.20 Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities.21
In theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain. Ownership is becoming more concentrated, as witnessed by companies purchasing and holding them for price appreciation and investment fund managers buying them to hold in their funds. 
One of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However, [mining popular cryptocurrencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/news/how-get-established-cryptocurrency-miner/>) requires considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume. The expensive energy costs and the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms whose revenues run into billions of dollars. 
Only 61 (1%) of the 4,568 Bitcoin blocks opened from May 15, 2024, to June 15, 2024, were opened by unknown addresses. The other 99% were opened by mining pools.22
Though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins.23
Cryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility, so investments [require accurate price monitoring](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/comparison-cryptocurrency-price-trackers/>). For example, Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later.24 Bitcoin prices had roared back by mid-2024. As a result of this vast range of volatility, many people consider cryptocurrencies a [speculative bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculativebubble.asp>). 
## Is Crypto Actually a Good Investment?
Crypto can be a good investment for someone who enjoys speculating and can financially tolerate losing everything invested. However, it is not a wise investment for someone seeking to grow their retirement portfolio or for placing savings into it for growth.
## Is Crypto Real Money?
One definition of money is something that is generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure or store of value, and a unit of account. By this definition, cryptocurrency is real money.
## How Does Crypto Make You Money?
There are several ways cryptocurrency can make money for you. Decentralized finance applications let you loan your crypto with interest; you can stake a compatible one on a blockchain or at certain exchanges for rewards, or you can hold on to it and hope its market value increases. None of these methods are guaranteed to make money, but many people have benefitted from them.
##  The Bottom Line 
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative, and it is important to [understand the risks involved](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/who-is-willy-woo-5235816>) before investing.

### Cryptocurrency Risks 
##### Facts About Paying With Cryptocurrency
There are many ways that paying with cryptocurrency is different from paying with a credit card or other traditional payment methods.
  1. **Cryptocurrency payments do not come with legal protections.** Credit cards and debit cards have legal protections if something goes wrong. For example, if you need to dispute a purchase, your credit card company has a process to help you get your money back. Cryptocurrencies typically do not come with any such protections.
  2. **Cryptocurrency payments typically are not reversible.** Once you pay with cryptocurrency, you can usually only get your money back if the person you paid sends it back. Before you buy something with cryptocurrency, know the seller’s reputation, by doing some research before you pay.
  3. **Some information about your transactions will likely be public.** People talk about cryptocurrency transactions as anonymous. But the truth is not that simple. Cryptocurrency transactions will typically be recorded on a public ledger, called a “blockchain.” That’s a public list of every cryptocurrency transaction — both on the payment and receipt sides. Depending on the blockchain, the information added to the blockchain can include details like the transaction amount, as well as the sender’s and recipient’s wallet addresses. It’s sometimes possible to use transaction and wallet information to identify the people involved in a specific transaction. And when you buy something from a seller who collects other information about you, like a shipping address, that information can also be used to identify you later on.


##### Facts About Investing with Cryptocurrency
  * **Cryptocurrencies aren’t backed by a government or central bank.** Unlike most traditional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the value of a cryptocurrency is not tied to promises by a government or a central bank.
  * **If you store your cryptocurrency online, you don’t have the same protections as a bank account.** Holdings in online “wallets” are not insured by the government like U.S. bank deposits are.
  * **A cryptocurrency’s value can change constantly and dramatically.** An investment that may be worth thousands of dollars today could be worth only hundreds tomorrow. If the value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again.
  * **Nothing about cryptocurrencies makes them a foolproof investment.** Just like with any investment opportunity, there are no guarantees.
  * **No one can guarantee you’ll make money off your investment.** Anyone who promises you a guaranteed return or profit is likely scamming you. Just because the cryptocurrency is well-known or has celebrities endorsing it doesn’t mean it’s a good investment.
  * **Not all cryptocurrencies or the companies behind them are the same.** Before you decide to invest in a cryptocurrency, look into the claims the company is making. Do an internet search with the name of the company and the cryptocurrency with words like review, scam, or complaint. Look through several pages of search results.


[Beware of Crypto Scams](https://portal.ct.gov/dob/consumer/consumer-education/<https:/portal.ct.gov/-/media/dob/consumer/beware-of-crypto-scams-ctdob.pdf?rev=abfcb89ba3c8480f8a8d2c87e4e03786&hash=FD0E8DDD2C86DF68D942A7F9BE4FDBA6>) - A two-page, printable infographic that shows common cryptocurrency scams and tips to avoid them.
##### Protect Your Money and Avoid Investment Scams
Investments tied to cryptocurrencies and digital assets were cited by state securities regulators as the [top threat to investors in 2022](https://portal.ct.gov/dob/consumer/consumer-education/<https:/www.nasaa.org/61477/nasaa-reveals-top-investor-threats-for-2022/?qoid=newsroom>), according to the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). Investors are urged to practice the following tips to identify and avoid investment scams:
  1. **Anyone can be anyone on the Internet.** Scammers are spoofing websites and using fake social media accounts to obscure their identities. Investors should always take steps to identify phony accounts by looking closely at content, analyzing dates of inception and considering the quality of engagement. To ensure investors do not accidently deal with an imposter firm, pay careful attention to domain names and learn more about how to protect your online accounts.
  2. **Beware of fake client reviews.** Scammers often reference or publish positive, yet bogus testimonials purportedly drafted by satisfied customers. These testimonials create the appearance the promoter is reliable – he or she has already earned significant profits in the past, and new investors can reap the same financial benefits as prior investors. In many cases, though, the reviews are drafted not by a satisfied customer but by the scammer. Learn how to protect yourself with NASAA’s Informed Investor Advisory on social media, online trading and investing,
  3. **If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.** Bad actors often entice new investors by promising the payment of safe, lucrative, guaranteed returns over relatively short terms – sometimes measured in hours or days instead of months or years. These representations are often a red flag for fraud, as all investments carry some degree of risk, and the potential profits are typically correlated with the degree of risk. Learn more about the warning signs of investment fraud.

## What is cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency (or “crypto”) is a digital currency, such as Bitcoin, that is used as an alternative payment method or speculative investment. Cryptocurrencies get their name from the cryptographic techniques that let people spend them securely without the need for a central government or bank.
Here are a few examples: 
  * [Bitcoin](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-is-bitcoin>) was initially developed primarily to be a form of payment that isn't controlled or distributed by a central bank. While financial institutions have traditionally been necessary to verify that a payment has been processed successfully, Bitcoin accomplishes this securely, without that central authority. 
  * [Ethereum](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/ethereum>) uses the same underlying technology as Bitcoin, but instead of strictly peer-to-peer payments, the cryptocurrency is used to pay for transactions on the Ethereum network. This network, built on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/blockchain>), enables entire financial ecosystems to operate without a central authority. To visualize this, think insurance without the insurance company, or real estate titling without the title company.
  * Scores of [altcoins](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-are-altcoins>) (broadly defined as any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) arose to capitalize on the various — and at times promising — use cases for blockchain technology.

## Why do people invest in cryptocurrencies?
People invest in cryptocurrencies for the same reason anyone invests in anything. They hope its value will rise, netting them a profit.
If demand for Bitcoin grows, for example, the interplay of supply and demand could push up its value. If people began using Bitcoin for payments on a huge scale, demand for Bitcoin would go up, and in turn, its price in dollars would increase. So, if you'd purchased one Bitcoin before that increase in demand, you could theoretically sell that one Bitcoin for more U.S. dollars than you bought it for, making a profit. 
The same principles apply to [](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/ethereum>)Ethereum. "Ether" is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, where developers can build financial apps without the need for a third-party financial institution. Developers must use Ether to build and run applications on Ethereum, so theoretically, the more that is built on the Ethereum blockchain, the higher the demand for Ether. 
However, it's important to note that to some, cryptocurrencies aren't investments at all. Bitcoin enthusiasts, for example, hail it as a much-improved monetary system over our current one and would prefer we spend and accept it as everyday payment. One common refrain — "one Bitcoin is one Bitcoin" — underscores the view that Bitcoin shouldn't be measured in USD, but rather by the value it brings as a new monetary system. 
## How does cryptocurrency work?
Cryptocurrencies are supported by a technology known as blockchain, which maintains a tamper-resistant record of transactions and keeps track of who owns what. The use of blockchains addressed a problem faced by previous efforts to create purely digital currencies: preventing people from making copies of their holdings and attempting to spend it twice

.
Individual units of cryptocurrencies can be referred to as coins or tokens, depending on how they are used. Some are intended to be units of exchange for goods and services, others are stores of value, and some can be used to participate in specific software programs such as games and financial products.
## How are cryptocurrencies created?
One common way cryptocurrencies are created is through a process known as mining, which is used by Bitcoin. [Bitcoin mining](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/bitcoin-mining>) can be an energy-intensive process in which computers solve complex puzzles in order to verify the authenticity of transactions on the network. As a reward, the owners of those computers can receive newly created cryptocurrency. Other cryptocurrencies use different methods to create and distribute tokens, and many have a significantly lighter environmental impact.
For most people, the easiest way to get cryptocurrency is to buy it, either from an exchange or another user.
## Why are there so many kinds of cryptocurrency?
It’s important to remember that Bitcoin is different from cryptocurrency in general. While Bitcoin is the first and most valuable cryptocurrency, the market is large — there are thousands of cryptocurrencies. And while some cryptocurrencies have total market valuations in the hundreds of billions of dollars, others are obscure and essentially worthless.
If you’re thinking about getting into cryptocurrency, it can be helpful to start with one that is commonly traded and relatively well-established in the market. These coins typically have the largest [market capitalizations](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-is-market-cap>). 
Thoughtfully selecting your cryptocurrency, however, is no guarantee of success in such a volatile space. Sometimes, an issue in the deeply interconnected crypto industry can spill out and have broad implications on asset values.
## Are cryptocurrencies financial securities, like stocks?
Whether or not cryptocurrency is a security is a bit of a gray area right now. To back up a little, generally, a "security" in finance is anything that represents a value and can be traded. Stocks are securities because they represent ownership in a public company. Bonds are securities because they represent a debt owed to the bondholder. And both of these securities can be traded on public markets.
Regulators have increasingly signaled that cryptocurrencies should be regulated similarly to other securities, such as stocks and bonds. However, with the June 2024 [Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo Supreme Court ruling](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/chevron-deference-investors>), that may change — Congress may have to clearly define crypto regulation through law making rather than allowing the SEC to enforce rules based on its interpretation. That could have major implications for the asset class in the future.
## Pros and cons of cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency inspires passionate opinions across the spectrum of investors. Here are a few reasons that some people believe it is a transformational technology, while others worry it's a fad.
### Cryptocurrency pros
  * Cryptocurrency is a volatile investment, but in the long term, many coins have risen in value considerably. Bitcoin's price has increased roughly tenfold over the last five years, despite several bull and bear markets over that time. It topped $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, although it has since fallen below that level.
  * Some supporters like the fact that cryptocurrency removes central banks from managing the money supply since over time these banks tend to reduce the value of money via inflation.
  * In communities that have been underserved by the traditional financial system, some people see cryptocurrencies as a promising foothold. Pew Research Center data from 2021 found that Asian, Black and Hispanic people "are more likely than White adults to say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency
[2]
Pew Research Center. [16% of Americans Say They Have Ever Invested in, Traded or Used Cryptocurrency](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/11/16-of-americans-say-they-have-ever-invested-in-traded-or-used-cryptocurrency/>). Accessed 19 Apr 2022.
[View all sources](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<#citation-list>)
."
  * Other advocates like the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies, because it’s a decentralized processing and recording system and can be more secure than traditional payment systems.
  * Some cryptocurrencies offer their owners the opportunity to earn [passive income](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-is-passive-income-and-how-do-i-earn-it>) through a process called staking. [Crypto staking](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-crypto-staking-works>) involves using your cryptocurrencies to help verify transactions on a blockchain protocol. Though staking has its risks, it can allow you to grow your crypto holdings without buying more.


### Cryptocurrency cons
  * Many cryptocurrency projects are untested, and blockchain technology in general has yet to gain wide adoption. If the underlying idea behind cryptocurrency does not reach its potential, long-term investors may never see the returns they hoped for.
  * For shorter-term crypto investors, there are other risks. Its prices tend to change rapidly, and while that means that many people have made money quickly by buying in at the right time, many others have lost money by doing so just before a [crypto crash](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/crypto-crash>).
  * Those wild shifts in value may also cut against the basic ideas behind the projects that cryptocurrencies were created to support. For example, people may be less likely to use Bitcoin as a payment system if they are not sure what it will be worth the next day.
  * The environmental impact of Bitcoin and other projects that use similar mining protocols is significant. A comparison by the University of Cambridge, for instance, said worldwide Bitcoin mining consumes more than twice as much power as all U.S. residential lighting

[View all sources](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<#citation-list>)
. Some cryptocurrencies use different technology that demands less energy.
  * Governments around the world have not yet fully reckoned with how to handle cryptocurrency, so regulatory changes and crackdowns have the potential to affect the market in unpredictable ways.
  * Many cryptocurrency networks charge a fee for any transaction, including buying or selling crypto as an investor. These can vary wildly, and high fees can cut into returns. [Bitcoin transaction fees](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin#fees>), for example, have varied between less than 50 cents and more than $100 per transaction over the last year, during periods of exceptionally low or high transaction activity.


## Cryptocurrency legal and tax issues
There’s no question that cryptocurrencies are legal in the U.S. Ultimately whether they’re legal worldwide depends on each individual country.
The question of whether cryptocurrencies are legally allowed, however, is only one part of the legal question. Other things to consider include how crypto is taxed and what you can buy with cryptocurrency.
  * Legal tender: You might call them cryptocurrencies, but they differ from traditional currencies in one important way: there's no requirement in most places that they be accepted as "legal tender." The U.S. dollar, by contrast, must be accepted for "all debts, public and private." Countries around the world are taking various approaches to cryptocurrency. For now, in the U.S., what you can buy with cryptocurrency depends on the preferences of the seller.
  * Crypto taxes: Again, the term "currency" is a bit of a red herring when it comes to taxes in the U.S. Cryptocurrencies are taxed as property, rather than currency. That means that when you sell them, you'll pay tax on the capital gains, or the difference between the price of the purchase and sale. And if you're given crypto as payment — or as a reward for an activity such as mining — you'll be taxed on the value at the time you received them.

## Your decision: Is cryptocurrency a good investment?
Cryptocurrency is a relatively risky investment, no matter which way you slice it. Generally speaking, high-risk investments should make up a small part of your overall portfolio — one common guideline is no more than 10%. You may want to look first to shore up your retirement savings, pay off debt or invest in less-volatile funds made up of stocks and bonds.
There are other ways to manage risk within your crypto portfolio, such as by diversifying the range of cryptocurrencies that you buy. Crypto assets may rise and fall at different rates, and over different time periods, so by investing in several different products you can insulate yourself — to some degree — from losses in one of your holdings.
Perhaps the most important thing when investing in anything is to do your homework. This is particularly important when it comes to cryptocurrencies, which are often linked to a specific technological product that is being developed or rolled out. When you buy a stock, it is linked to a company that is subject to well-defined financial reporting requirements, which can give you a sense of its prospects.
With cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, discerning which projects are viable can be more challenging. If you have a financial advisor who is familiar with cryptocurrency, it may be worth asking for input.
For beginning investors, it can also be worthwhile to examine how widely a cryptocurrency is being used. Most reputable crypto projects have publicly available metrics showing data such as how many transactions are being carried out on their platforms. If use of a cryptocurrency is growing, that may be a sign that it is establishing itself in the market. Cryptocurrencies also generally make "white papers" available to explain how they'll work and how they intend to distribute tokens.
» Storing crypto? These are the [top crypto wallets](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/best-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-wallet>)
If you're looking to invest in less established crypto products, here are some additional questions to consider:
  * Who’s heading the project? An identifiable and well-known leader is a positive sign.
  * Are there other major investors who are investing in it? It’s a good sign if other well-known investors want a piece of the currency.
  * Will you own a portion in the company or just currency or tokens? This distinction is important. Being a part owner means you get to participate in its earnings (you’re an owner), while buying tokens simply means you're entitled to use them, like chips in a casino.
  * Is the currency already developed, or is the company looking to raise money to develop it? The further along the product, the less risky it is.


It can take a lot of work to comb through a prospectus; the more detail it has, the better your chances it’s legitimate. But even legitimacy doesn’t mean the currency will succeed. That’s an entirely separate question, and that requires a lot of market savvy. Be sure to consider how to protect yourself from fraudsters who see cryptocurrencies as an opportunity to bilk investors.
Frequently asked questions
How does a blockchain work?
Most cryptocurrencies are based on [blockchain technology](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/blockchain>), a networking protocol through which computers can work together to keep a shared, tamper-proof record of transactions. The challenge in a blockchain network is in making sure that all participants can agree on the correct copy of the historical ledger. Without a recognized way to validate transactions, it would be difficult for people to trust that their holdings are secure. There are several ways of reaching "consensus" on a blockchain network, but the two that are most widely used are known as "proof of work" and "proof of stake.”
What does proof of work mean?
[Proof of work](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/proof-of-work>) is one way of incentivizing users to help maintain an accurate historical record of who owns what on a blockchain network. Bitcoin uses proof of work, which makes this method an important part of the crypto conversation. Blockchains rely on users to collate and submit blocks of recent transactions for inclusion in the ledger, and Bitcoin's protocol rewards them for doing so successfully. This process is known as mining.
There is stiff competition for these rewards, so many users try to submit blocks, but only one can be selected for each new block of transactions. To decide who gets the reward, Bitcoin requires users to solve a difficult puzzle, which uses a huge amount of energy and computing power. The completion of this puzzle is the "work" in proof of work.
For lucky miners, the Bitcoin rewards are more than enough to offset the costs involved. But the huge upfront cost is also a way to discourage dishonest players. If you win the right to create a block, it might not be worth the risk of tampering with the records and having your submission thrown out — forfeiting the reward. In this instance, spending the money on energy costs in an attempt to tamper with the historical record would have resulted in significant loss.
Ultimately, the goal of proof of work is to make it more rewarding to play by the rules than to try to break them.
» Learn more:[How does Bitcoin work?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-is-bitcoin>)
What is proof of stake?
[Proof of stake](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/proof-of-stake>) is another way of achieving consensus about the accuracy of the historical record of transactions on a blockchain. It eschews mining in favor of a process known as staking, in which people put some of their own cryptocurrency holdings at stake to vouch for the accuracy of their work in validating new transactions. Some of the cryptocurrencies that use proof of stake include Cardano, Solana and Ethereum (which is in the process of converting from proof of work).
Proof of stake systems have some similarities to proof of work protocols, in that they rely on users to collect and submit new transactions. But they have a different way of incentivizing honest behavior among those who participate in that process. Essentially, people who propose new blocks of information to be added to the record must put some cryptocurrency at stake. In many cases, your chances of landing a new block (and the associated rewards) go up as you put more at stake. People who submit inaccurate data can lose some of the money they've put at risk.
How do you mine cryptocurrency?
Mining cryptocurrency is generally only possible for a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. And before you get too far, it is worth noting that the barriers to entry can be high and the probability of success relatively low without major investment.
While early Bitcoin users were able to mine the cryptocurrency using regular computers, the task has gotten more difficult as the network has grown. Now, most miners use special computers whose sole job is to run the complex calculations involved in mining all day every day. And even one of these computers isn't going to guarantee you success. Many miners use entire warehouses full of mining equipment in their quest to collect rewards.
If you don’t have the resources to compete with the heavy hitters, one option is joining a mining pool, where users share rewards. This reduces the size of the reward you'd get for a successful block, but increases the chance that you could at least get some return on your investment.
How do you pull your money out of crypto?
Just like with buying cryptocurrencies, there are several options for converting your crypto holdings into cash. While decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer transactions may be right for some investors, many choose to use centralized services to offload their holdings.
With a centralized exchange, the process is basically the reverse of buying. But one advantage if you own crypto is that you probably already have everything set up. Here are the steps:
  * Connect the wallet that holds the cryptocurrencies that you want to sell, and make sure the exchange you’ve chosen supports both that wallet and the asset in question.
  * Move your cryptocurrency onto the exchange.
  * Sell your cryptocurrency.
  * Transfer the proceeds back to your bank account.


Every exchange will handle such transactions differently, so you’ll want to look up the fees and processes for your specific provider. Also, remember that you may be creating [crypto tax](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/bitcoin-taxes>) liability when you sell your digital assets.

The completion of this puzzle is the "work" in proof of work.
For lucky miners, the Bitcoin rewards are more than enough to offset the costs involved. But the huge upfront cost is also a way to discourage dishonest players. If you win the right to create a block, it might not be worth the risk of tampering with the records and having your submission thrown out — forfeiting the reward. In this instance, spending the money on energy costs in an attempt to tamper with the historical record would have resulted in significant loss.
Ultimately, the goal of proof of work is to make it more rewarding to play by the rules than to try to break them.

What is proof of stake?
[Proof of stake](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/proof-of-stake>)
is another way of achieving consensus about the accuracy of the historical record of transactions on a blockchain. It eschews mining in favor of a process known as staking, in which people put some of their own cryptocurrency holdings at stake to vouch for the accuracy of their work in validating new transactions. Some of the cryptocurrencies that use proof of stake include Cardano, Solana and Ethereum (which is in the process of converting from proof of work).
Proof of stake systems have some similarities to proof of work protocols, in that they rely on users to collect and submit new transactions. But they have a different way of incentivizing honest behavior among those who participate in that process. Essentially, people who propose new blocks of information to be added to the record must put some cryptocurrency at stake. In many cases, your chances of landing a new block (and the associated rewards) go up as you put more at stake. People who submit inaccurate data can lose some of the money they've put at risk.
How do you mine cryptocurrency?
Mining cryptocurrency is generally only possible for a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. And before you get too far, it is worth noting that the barriers to entry can be high and the probability of success relatively low without major investment.
While early Bitcoin users were able to mine the cryptocurrency using regular computers, the task has gotten more difficult as the network has grown. Now, most miners use special computers whose sole job is to run the complex calculations involved in mining all day every day. And even one of these computers isn't going to guarantee you success. Many miners use entire warehouses full of mining equipment in their quest to collect rewards.
If you don’t have the resources to compete with the heavy hitters, one option is joining a mining pool, where users share rewards. This reduces the size of the reward you'd get for a successful block, but increases the chance that you could at least get some return on your investment.
How do you pull your money out of crypto?
Just like with buying cryptocurrencies, there are several options for converting your crypto holdings into cash. While decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer transactions may be right for some investors, many choose to use centralized services to offload their holdings.
With a centralized exchange, the process is basically the reverse of buying. But one advantage if you own crypto is that you probably already have everything set up. Here are the steps:
  * Connect the wallet that holds the cryptocurrencies that you want to sell, and make sure the exchange you’ve chosen supports both that wallet and the asset in question.
  * Move your cryptocurrency onto the exchange.
  * Sell your cryptocurrency.
  * Transfer the proceeds back to your bank account.


Every exchange will handle such transactions differently, so you’ll want to look up the fees and processes for your specific provider. Also, remember that you may be creating

As a newer investment, cryptocurrency has gotten a lot of buzz. It has received celebrity endorsements, helped a select few get rich quick and made headlines for various scams and fraud in the industry.
Soon, cryptocurrency may move even further into the spotlight, as President-elect Donald Trump has promised pro-crypto policy when he takes office for his second term. "Since Donald Trump was elected president last month, the price of Bitcoin has smashed through the $100,000 barrier — hitting a record high of $103,259 on [Dec. 4], a nearly 50% gain since Nov. 5 — in large part because of the president-elect's perceived cryptophilia," said [_Barron's_](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/www.barrons.com/articles/trump-bitcoin-crypto-ether-052688ed>).
If you have not already bought in, you may be wondering: Is crypto worth investing in? Before you make any decisions, it is worth weighing its pros and cons.

## What exactly is cryptocurrency?
Before we get into whether to invest in crypto, let's review what crypto actually is. Effectively, said [_NerdWallet_](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/cryptocurrency>), cryptocurrency "is a digital currency, such as [Bitcoin](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/theweek.com/business/economy/donald-trumps-bitcoin-obsession>), that is used as an alternative payment method or speculative investment," meaning an investor hopes to profit from a change in value when they go to sell.
Typically, "cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology — a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers" and "are generally not issued by [any central authority](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/theweek.com/business/bitcoin-founder-satoshi-nakamoto>), rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation," said [_Investopedia_](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp#toc-what-is-cryptocurrency>).
## What are the upsides of investing in crypto?
Depending on the type of investor you are and your tolerance for risk, crypto can offer upsides as an investment, including:
**It is a decentralized currency.** For many, a major upside of crypto is that it is a "decentralized currency, meaning it's not regulated by a single government or central bank," said [_Credit Karma_](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/creditkarma.myi4.net/c/221109/628437/10161?subId1=theweekus-us-7863778517098692740&sharedId=theweekus-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.creditkarma.com%2Finvestments%2Fi%2Fpros-and-cons-of-bitcoin>). In other words, "governments can't control [crypto] like they can with centralized fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar."
**It offers diversification.** One potential benefit of crypto for your portfolio is that owning some "can increase your portfolio's diversification since cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have historically shown few price correlations with the U.S. stock market," said [_The Motley Fool_](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1679923&xcust=theweekus_us_3771853814783444303&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2Fstock-market%2Fmarket-sectors%2Ffinancials%2Fcryptocurrency-stocks%2Fis-cryptocurrency-good-investment%2F%23toc_risks-of-investing-in-cryptocurrency&sref=https%3A%2F%2Ftheweek.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Fcryptocurrency-investing-pros-cons>). Diversification is key when investing, as it spreads your portfolio across a number of different types of assets, buffering against market volatility.
**It may provide sizable returns.** Though it is far from guaranteed this will happen, "several cryptocurrencies have seen their prices skyrocket since first being introduced," said [Bankrate](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/where-trump-and-harris-stand-on-crypto/>). This translates to "the potential for large gains on your [investment](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/theweek.com/personal-finance/avoid-emotional-investing>)."
**It is accessible.** Another benefit of crypto is that it "can be easily accessible to everyone around the clock, even those without access to traditional banking," whether due to a checkered banking history, lack of documentation or lack of proximity to bank branches, said [_Fidelity_](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/crypto/risks-and-benefits-of-crypto>). Further, "crypto transactions can have lower fees and faster transfer times than some traditional bank transactions."
## Are there risks or drawbacks to crypto?
While past tales of people making bank on crypto may seem tempting, it is important to heavily weigh the downsides of this investment as well:
**It is extremely volatile.** While risk of loss is possible with any type of investment," crypto's [elevated volatility](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/theweek.com/tech/2023-crypto-instability>) makes it an even bigger risk factor," said [_Forbes_](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/should-you-invest-in-crypto/>). As just one example, "Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later," said Investopedia. Further, said Bankrate, since cryptocurrencies "aren't backed by anything," that means "the price they trade at is determined by the whims of traders."
**It is susceptible to hacks and scams.** Fraud and [hacks](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/theweek.com/tech/data-breaches-increase-2023-internet-security-concerns>) are both common with crypto. That is because "though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked," said Investopedia. In the past, many exchanges and wallets have been hacked, "sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins." Plus, said Bankrate, "it is often difficult to recover stolen funds."
**It lacks government regulation.** While some may see it as an upside that crypto is largely unregulated, that can bring some downsides as well. "Governments around the world have not yet fully reckoned with how to handle cryptocurrency, so regulatory changes and crackdowns have the potential to affect the market in unpredictable ways," said NerdWallet. Leaving crypto unregulated also puts "investors at risk of market manipulation and fraud," said [_The Wall Street Journal_](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/www.wsj.com/articles/lack-of-crypto-audit-regulation-raises-questions-about-pcaob-authority-a558754>).
**It has a major environmental impact.** Crypto is often made [through mining](https://theweek.com/personal-finance/<https:/theweek.com/cryptocurrency/1018718/the-environmental-cost-of-crypto>), which "involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain," said Credit Karma. This "requires lots of computational power, which in turn requires a large amount of energy." In fact, according to "a comparison by the University of Cambridge," said NerdWallet, "worldwide Bitcoin mining consumes more than twice as much power as all U.S. residential lighting."

The following statements do not constitute an offer to conclude a contract for the purchase or sale of financial instruments and financial products or an invitation to submit such an offer and to buy or sell any particular digital asset.

The loss of access to data and passwords can also lead to a complete loss._**Summary:**
  * **Pros** : Cryptocurrencies are supported by secure, decentralized blockchain technology, independent of traditional banking systems. They operate 24/7, and market volatility can mean a chance of greater returns.
  * **Cons** : Cryptocurrencies often see extreme price fluctuations. There’s a steep learning curve, and it can be tough to scale widely.
  * Despite the potential for high rewards, it’s still uncertain whether cryptocurrencies will stay viable in the long term. There are also security vulnerabilities that may pose significant risks, especially to new investors.

Cryptocurrencies have the potential to reshape the financial world as we know it, and to question the very existence of traditional financial infrastructure. But what are the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies? How do you decide which one to invest in—or whether to invest at all?If you’re a little confused by cryptocurrencies, don’t worry. We’re here to break down the advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrency, so you can learn everything you need to know. And if you’re still stuck, check out our guide to [Cryptocurrencies for Beginners](https://n26.com/en-eu/blog/<https:/n26.com/en-eu/blog/what-is-cryptocurrency>).
#### Cryptocurrency Explained in 26 Seconds 
## **6 advantages of cryptocurrency**
While cryptocurrencies are a relatively recent invention (Bitcoin, for example, started up in 2009), they’re definitely here to stay, with all their benefits. From prospects of hefty returns to 24/7 trading on ultra-secure, transparent infrastructure, the world of crypto has plenty to offer—if you know how to tap into it.
### **1. High risk—and the potential for high rewards**
There are more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies on the market today and each one has its own particular quirks. But all cryptocurrencies have a few things in common—like their tendency to experience sudden spikes (and drops) in value. Prices are driven primarily by the supply of coins from miners and the demand for them by purchasers. And these supply-demand dynamics can result in hefty returns. The price of Ethereum, for example, roughly doubled from July 2021 to December 2021—quite the payday for investors who got on board at the right time. The high risk, however, became apparent shortly afterwards when the Ether price fell below €1,000 – representing a reduction of over 70% since Christmas 2021.
### **2. The blockchain technology underlying cryptocurrency is inherently secure**
Some of the major benefits of cryptocurrencies aren’t linked to the currencies themselves, but to the infrastructure that supports them. That’s the [blockchain](https://n26.com/en-eu/blog/<https:/n26.com/en-eu/blog/what-is-a-blockchain>)—the decentralized data-storage ledger that tracks every transaction undertaken on it. Once you make an entry in the blockchain, it can never be erased. And with the blockchain stored decentrally across multiple computers, no hacker can access the entire chain in one go; any information stored in it is safe for good.

### **3. Bye bye traditional banks—hello to a fairer, more transparent financial system**
By and large, our financial system revolves around third-party intermediaries who process transactions. This means that if you make a transaction, you’re placing your trust in one or more of these intermediaries—and the recession of the early 2000s made a lot of people wonder if that was a good idea. The blockchain and cryptocurrencies offer an alternative. They can be viewed by anyone, anywhere, so you can take part in the financial markets and make transactions with no intermediaries whatsoever.
### **4. Crypto trades around the clock**
Another advantage that cryptocurrencies have over banks is that the crypto markets are always open. With coins being mined and transactions being recorded around the clock, you don’t have to wait for the NYSE, NASDAQ or any other exchange to start trading for the day if you want to buy, sell, or trade crypto. This has made such an impact that regular stock exchanges are looking into the option of trading stocks outside of regular banking hours as well—although that might still be some way off. So, for investors who are on the go 24/7, crypto might be the best way to generate returns outside of normal working hours.
### **5. Cryptocurrencies could help investors beat inflation**
Cryptocurrencies aren’t tied to a single currency or economy, so their price reflects global demand rather than, say, national inflation. But what about inflation of cryptocurrencies themselves? As an investor you can rest easy, for the most part. The number of coins is capped, so the amount available can’t spiral out of control, thus, no inflation. Some coins (like Bitcoin) have an overall cap, others (like Ethereum) have an annual cap, but either way, this approach keeps inflation at bay.
### 6. Accessibility and Financial Inclusion:
Cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations around the world. With just a smartphone and internet access, anyone can participate in the global financial system, opening up opportunities for economic empowerment and inclusion.
## 6**disadvantages of cryptocurrency**
So that’s a lot of glitter, but is the outlook for cryptocurrencies really so golden? Let’s take a look at some of the drawbacks. Some are easily resolved, others less so—but it always pays to keep them in mind.
### **1. Understanding cryptocurrency takes time and effort**
Cryptocurrencies can take a while to get your head around. If you’re not a digital native, the concept of cryptocurrency (let alone the blockchain) can feel anything but second nature. And trying to invest in something you don’t really understand is itself a risk. There are plenty of online resources available to help you (including N26’s _blog series_ on crypto), but you’ll still need to dedicate some time to truly understand the pros and cons of investing in cryptocurrency.
### **2. Cryptocurrencies can be an extremely volatile investment**
While the price of a cryptocurrency can spike to dizzying highs (with associated benefits for investors!) they can also crash to terrifying lows just as quickly. So if you’re looking to make stable returns, this might not be the best bet. The cryptocurrency market fundamentally thrives on speculation, and its relatively small size makes it more vulnerable to price fluctuations. That in turn can wreak havoc with the value of coins—one of the major disadvantages of cryptocurrency.
### **3. Cryptocurrencies haven’t proven themselves as a long-term investment—yet**
While cryptocurrencies have become widely known and are still gaining in popularity, it’s worth remembering that they have only been around for just over a decade. The concept only really emerged with the publication of a white paper on Bitcoin in 2008. Stock markets, in contrast, can look back on centuries of history. The London Stock Exchange, for example, was founded in 1801. Gold has been a proven custodian of value for millennia. But cryptocurrencies? Nobody really knows what will happen to cryptocurrencies in the future—and you need to be brave to enter these uncharted waters as an investor.
### **4. Crypto has serious scalability issues**
You could be forgiven for thinking that digital currencies operate at lightning speed—and they do, up to a point. But at a certain level they run into major issues which make it difficult to roll them out on a large scale. Cryptocurrency providers themselves admit this is an issue, with the people behind Ethereum saying that the blockchain has reached “certain capacity limitations” that slow the rate at which transactions can be processed. This can be a frustrating experience for transaction participants, to say nothing of the potential financial losses it can cause.
### **5. Crypto newbies are vulnerable to security risks**
Cryptocurrencies might not have the risks that come with using central intermediaries, but that doesn’t mean they’re completely free from security issues. As a crypto owner, you could lose the private key that lets you access your coins—and with it, all your holdings. And then there’s hacking, phishing, and all the other attempts to gain control by malicious means. This is something that seasoned investors keep an eye out for, but newer investors are more likely to be vulnerable to these kinds of traps.
### 6. The rules and regulations aren’t set in stone
The regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies is still evolving, with different countries and jurisdictions implementing varying regulations. This uncertainty can be challenging for investors and businesses operating in the cryptocurrency space, as they navigate compliance requirements and potential legal risks.

## **What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in?**
There’s no one cryptocurrency that’s substantially better than all the others. It comes down to personal preference, but there are things that you might like to look out for. Think about your individual risk tolerance; can you stand to lose a substantial chunk of your investment if your chosen coin plummets in value? Are you using the coin solely to generate returns, or are you hoping to pay for things with it, too? Is it just about the money, or are you looking to invest in a coin with a broader social or environmental impact? One easy approach is simply to pick the market leader, Bitcoin. It’s the original cryptocurrency and the one which has built up the largest information base as well.
## **What are the pros and cons of Bitcoin?**
Bitcoin, which trades under the abbreviation BTC, comes with a host of benefits. It’s capped at 21 million coins, it’s guaranteed to be inflation-proof, and its headline-grabbing prices certainly offer investors scope for reaping rewards. And Bitcoin is the most widely accepted cryptocurrency for payments. Of course, it has its drawbacks. Bitcoin’s blockchain infrastructure starts to slow down once it exceeds a rate of seven transactions per second (a real issue when you consider that Visa processes around 1,700 transactions per second!). And because it’s the best-known cryptocurrency of them all, it’s a key target for hackers and scammers of all stripes. For more insight about Bitcoin, check out our article _What is Bitcoin?_.
## **What else should I know before trading cryptocurrency?**
Cryptocurrencies can be a minefield for new investors. From unfamiliar terminology to complex technology, it’s a topic that takes some getting used to. As with everything, trading cryptocurrencies comes with benefits and risks, but N26 is here to help. Whether you want to pay for everyday essentials with Bitcoin or use another coin to beef up your investment portfolio, we can show you all the pros and cons of cryptocurrency.

### 
### How do cryptocurrency transactions work?
Cryptocurrency transactions happen through a digital currency exchange (DCE), also known as an exchange. This service is provided by different online companies. You can use various payment methods, such as credit cards or transferring funds, to purchase cryptocurrencies. You can then sell your crypto or use it to buy other cryptocurrencies on these platforms.
### 
### What are the key benefits of cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrencies offer transparency and freedom from traditional financial infrastructures and have the potential for dazzling investment returns.
### 
### What are the advantages of cryptocurrency mining?
The main advantage is that cryptocurrency miners receive crypto in the currency they're mining. For some miners, it's also exciting to participate in decentralized finance.
### 
### How do I weigh up the pros and cons of each cryptocurrency?
It’s all about personal preference—your appetite for risk, plus what you’re really hoping to achieve from a crypto investment.
