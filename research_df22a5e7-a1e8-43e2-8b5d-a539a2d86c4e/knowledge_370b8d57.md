In 2014, the IRS issued [Notice 2014-21, 2014-16 I.R.B. 938](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</irb/2014-16_IRB#NOT-2014-21> "Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2014-16"), explaining that virtual currency is treated as property for federal income tax purposes and providing examples of how longstanding tax principles applicable to transactions involving property apply to virtual currency. The frequently asked questions (“FAQs”) below expand upon the examples provided in Notice 2014-21 and apply those same longstanding tax principles to additional situations.
**Note:** Except as otherwise noted, these FAQs apply only to taxpayers who hold virtual currency as a capital asset. For more information on the definition of a capital asset, examples of what is and is not a capital asset, and the tax treatment of property transactions generally, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "About Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets").
#### [Q1. What is virtual currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470091_398944>)
A1. Virtual currency is a digital representation of value, other than a representation of the U.S. dollar or a foreign currency (“real currency”), that functions as a unit of account, a store of value, and a medium of exchange. Some virtual currencies are convertible, which means that they have an equivalent value in real currency or act as a substitute for real currency. The IRS uses the term “virtual currency” in these FAQs to describe the various types of convertible virtual currency that are used as a medium of exchange, such as digital currency and cryptocurrency. Regardless of the label applied, if a particular asset has the characteristics of virtual currency, it will be treated as virtual currency for Federal income tax purposes. 
#### [Q2. How is virtual currency treated for federal income tax purposes?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470101_468083>)
A2. Virtual currency is treated as property and general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. For more information on the tax treatment of virtual currency, see Notice 2014-21. For more information on the tax treatment of property transactions, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "About Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets").
#### [Q3. What is cryptocurrency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470103_896322>)
A3. Cryptocurrency is a type of virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions that are digitally recorded on a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain. A transaction involving cryptocurrency that is recorded on a distributed ledger is referred to as an “on-chain” transaction; a transaction that is not recorded on the distributed ledger is referred to as an “off-chain” transaction.
#### [Q4. Will I recognize a gain or loss when I sell my virtual currency for real currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470106_883855>)
A4. Yes. When you sell virtual currency, you must recognize any capital gain or loss on the sale, subject to any limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.

#### [Q5. The 2020 Form 1040 asks whether at any time during 2020, I received, sold, sent, exchanged, or otherwise acquired any financial interest in any virtual currency. During 2020, I purchased virtual currency with real currency and had no other virtual currency transactions during the year. Must I answer yes to the Form 1040 question? (updated March 2, 2021)](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470110_886093>)
A5. No. If your only transactions involving virtual currency during 2020 were purchases of virtual currency with real currency, you are not required to answer yes to the Form 1040 question.
#### [Q5(a). The 2021 Form 1040 asks whether at any time during 2021, I received, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of any financial interest in any virtual currency. During 2021, I purchased virtual currency with real currency and had no other virtual currency transactions during the year. How do I answer the question on the Form 1040? (added March 10, 2022)](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470112_492747>)
A5(a). If your only transactions involving virtual currency during 2021 were purchases of virtual currency with real currency, you are not required to answer “yes” to the Form 1040 question, and should, instead, check the “no” box.
#### [Q6. How do I determine if my gain or loss is a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470114_653347>)
A6. If you held the virtual currency for one year or less before selling or exchanging the virtual currency, then you will have a short-term capital gain or loss. If you held the virtual currency for more than one year before selling or exchanging it, then you will have a long-term capital gain or loss. The period during which you held the virtual currency (known as the “holding period”) begins on the day after you acquired the virtual currency and ends on the day you sell or exchange the virtual currency. For more information on short-term and long-term capital gains and losses, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "Publication 544").
#### [Q7. How do I calculate my gain or loss when I sell virtual currency for real currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470116_481496>)
A7. Your gain or loss will be the difference between your adjusted basis in the virtual currency and the amount you received in exchange for the virtual currency, which you should report on your Federal income tax return in U.S. dollars. For more information on gain or loss from sales or exchanges, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "Publication 544").
#### [Q8. How do I determine my basis in virtual currency I purchased with real currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470118_885238>)
A8. Your basis (also known as your “cost basis”) is the amount you spent to acquire the virtual currency, including fees, commissions and other acquisition costs in U.S. dollars. Your adjusted basis is your basis increased by certain expenditures and decreased by certain deductions or credits in U.S. dollars. For more information on basis, see [Publication 551, Basis of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-551> "About Publication 551, Basis of Assets").
#### [Q9. Do I have income if I provide someone with a service and that person pays me with virtual currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470121_727414>)
A9. Yes. When you receive property, including virtual currency, in exchange for performing services, whether or not you perform the services as an employee, you recognize ordinary income. For more information on compensation for services, see [Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-525> "About Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income").
#### [Q10. Does virtual currency received by an independent contractor for performing services constitute self-employment income?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470124_568229>)
A10. Yes. Generally, self-employment income includes all gross income derived by an individual from any trade or business carried on by the individual as other than an employee. Consequently, the fair market value of virtual currency received for services performed as an independent contractor, measured in U.S. dollars as of the date of receipt, constitutes self-employment income and is subject to the self-employment tax.
#### [Q11. Does virtual currency paid by an employer as remuneration for services constitute wages for employment tax purposes?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470126_859798>)
A11. Yes. Generally, the medium in which remuneration for services is paid is immaterial to the determination of whether the remuneration constitutes wages for employment tax purposes. Consequently, the fair market value of virtual currency paid as wages, measured in U.S. dollars at the date of receipt, is subject to Federal income tax withholding, Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) tax and must be reported on [Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-form-w-2> "About Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement "). See [Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide PDF](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<https:/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf> "Publication 15 Circular E Employer s Tax Guide"), for information on the withholding, depositing, reporting, and paying of employment taxes.
#### [Q12. How do I calculate my income if I provide a service and receive payment in virtual currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470129_897951>)
A12. The amount of income you must recognize is the fair market value of the virtual currency, in U.S. dollars, when received. In an on-chain transaction you receive the virtual currency on the date and at the time the transaction is recorded on the distributed ledger.
#### [Q13. How do I determine my basis in virtual currency I receive for services I’ve provided?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470131_999986>)
A13. If, as part of an arm’s length transaction, you provided someone with services and received virtual currency in exchange, your basis in that virtual currency is the fair market value of the virtual currency, in U.S. dollars, when the virtual currency is received. For more information on basis, see [Publication 551, Basis of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-551> "About Publication 551, Basis of Assets").
#### [Q14. Will I recognize a gain or loss if I pay someone with virtual currency for providing me with a service?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470133_742752>)
A14. Yes. If you pay for a service using virtual currency that you hold as a capital asset, then you have exchanged a capital asset for that service and will have a capital gain or loss. For more information on capital gains and capital losses, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "About Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets").
#### [Q15. How do I calculate my gain or loss when I pay for services using virtual currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470135_174936>)
A15. Your gain or loss is the difference between the fair market value of the services you received and your adjusted basis in the virtual currency exchanged. For more information on gain or loss from sales or exchanges, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "About Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets").
#### [Q16. Will I recognize a gain or loss if I exchange my virtual currency for other property?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470137_360927>)
A16. Yes. If you exchange virtual currency held as a capital asset for other property, including for goods or for another virtual currency, you will recognize a capital gain or loss. For more information on capital gains and capital losses, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "About Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets").
#### [Q17. How do I calculate my gain or loss when I exchange my virtual currency for other property?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470140_551885>)
A17. Your gain or loss is the difference between the fair market value of the property you received and your adjusted basis in the virtual currency exchanged. For more information on gain or loss from sales or exchanges, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "About Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets").
#### [Q18. How do I determine my basis in property I’ve received in exchange for virtual currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470142_271241>)
A18. If, as part of an arm’s length transaction, you transferred virtual currency to someone and received other property in exchange, your basis in that property is its fair market value at the time of the exchange. For more information on basis, see [Publication 551, Basis of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-551> "About Publication 551, Basis of Assets").
#### [Q19. Will I recognize a gain or loss if I sell or exchange property (other than U.S. dollars) for virtual currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470144_470134>)
A19. Yes. If you transfer property held as a capital asset in exchange for virtual currency, you will recognize a capital gain or loss. If you transfer property that is not a capital asset in exchange for virtual currency, you will recognize an ordinary gain or loss. For more information on gains and losses, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "About Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets").
#### [Q20. How do I calculate my gain or loss when I exchange property for virtual currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470147_497286>)
A20. Your gain or loss is the difference between the fair market value of the virtual currency when received (in general, when the transaction is recorded on the distributed ledger) and your adjusted basis in the property exchanged. For more information on gain or loss from sales or exchanges, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "About Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets").
#### [Q21. How do I determine my basis in virtual currency that I have received in exchange for property?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470149_701376>)
A21. If, as part of an arm’s length transaction, you transferred property to someone and received virtual currency in exchange, your basis in that virtual currency is the fair market value of the virtual currency, in U.S. dollars, when the virtual currency is received. For more information on basis, see [Publication 551, Basis of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-551> "About Publication 551, Basis of Assets").
#### [Q22. One of my cryptocurrencies went through a hard fork, but I did not receive any new cryptocurrency. Do I have income?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470151_665936>)
A22. A hard fork occurs when a cryptocurrency undergoes a protocol change resulting in a permanent diversion from the legacy distributed ledger. This may result in the creation of a new cryptocurrency on a new distributed ledger in addition to the legacy cryptocurrency on the legacy distributed ledger. If your cryptocurrency went through a hard fork, but you did not receive any new cryptocurrency, whether through an airdrop (a distribution of cryptocurrency to multiple taxpayers’ distributed ledger addresses) or some other kind of transfer, you don’t have taxable income.
#### [Q23. One of my cryptocurrencies went through a hard fork followed by an airdrop, and I received new cryptocurrency. Do I have income?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470153_592012>)
A23. If a hard fork is followed by an airdrop and you receive new cryptocurrency, you will have taxable income in the taxable year you receive that cryptocurrency.
#### [Q24. How do I calculate my income from cryptocurrency I received following a hard fork?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470155_272196>)
A24. When you receive cryptocurrency from an airdrop following a hard fork, you will have ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the new cryptocurrency when it is received, which is when the transaction is recorded on the distributed ledger, provided you have dominion and control over the cryptocurrency so that you can transfer, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of the cryptocurrency.
#### [Q25. How do I determine my basis in cryptocurrency I received following a hard fork?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470157_612434>)
A25. If you receive cryptocurrency from an airdrop following a hard fork, your basis in that cryptocurrency is equal to the amount you included in income on your Federal income tax return. The amount included in income is the fair market value of the cryptocurrency when you received it. You have received the cryptocurrency when you can transfer, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of it, which is generally the date and time the airdrop is recorded on the distributed ledger. See [Rev. Rul. 2019-24](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</irb/2019-44_IRB#REV-RUL-2019-24> "Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2019-44"). For more information on basis, see [Publication 551, Basis of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-551> "About Publication 551, Basis of Assets").
#### [Q26. I received cryptocurrency through a platform for trading cryptocurrency; that is, through a cryptocurrency exchange. How do I determine the cryptocurrency’s fair market value at the time of receipt?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470159_555128>)
A26. If you receive cryptocurrency in a transaction facilitated by a cryptocurrency exchange, the value of the cryptocurrency is the amount that is recorded by the cryptocurrency exchange for that transaction in U.S. dollars. If the transaction is facilitated by a centralized or decentralized cryptocurrency exchange but is not recorded on a distributed ledger or is otherwise an off-chain transaction, then the fair market value is the amount the cryptocurrency was trading for on the exchange at the date and time the transaction would have been recorded on the ledger if it had been an on-chain transaction.
#### [Q27. I received cryptocurrency in a peer-to-peer transaction or some other type of transaction that did not involve a cryptocurrency exchange. How do I determine the cryptocurrency’s fair market value at the time of receipt?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470162_222891>)
A27. If you receive cryptocurrency in a peer-to-peer transaction or some other transaction not facilitated by a cryptocurrency exchange, the fair market value of the cryptocurrency is determined as of the date and time the transaction is recorded on the distributed ledger, or would have been recorded on the ledger if it had been an on-chain transaction. The IRS will accept as evidence of fair market value the value as determined by a cryptocurrency or blockchain explorer that analyzes worldwide indices of a cryptocurrency and calculates the value of the cryptocurrency at an exact date and time. If you do not use an explorer value, you must establish that the value you used is an accurate representation of the cryptocurrency’s fair market value.
#### [Q28. I received cryptocurrency that does not have a published value in exchange for property or services. How do I determine the cryptocurrency’s fair market value?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470164_516827>)
A28. When you receive cryptocurrency in exchange for property or services, and that cryptocurrency is not traded on any cryptocurrency exchange and does not have a published value, then the fair market value of the cryptocurrency received is equal to the fair market value of the property or services exchanged for the cryptocurrency when the transaction occurs.
#### [Q29. When does my holding period start for cryptocurrency I receive?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470166_295937>)
A29. Your holding period begins the day after it is received. For more information on holding periods, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "About Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets").
#### [Q30. Do I have income when a soft fork of cryptocurrency I own occurs?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470168_408894>)
A30. No. A soft fork occurs when a distributed ledger undergoes a protocol change that does not result in a diversion of the ledger and thus does not result in the creation of a new cryptocurrency. Because soft forks do not result in you receiving new cryptocurrency, you will be in the same position you were in prior to the soft fork, meaning that the soft fork will not result in any income to you.
#### [Q31. I received virtual currency as a bona fide gift. Do I have income?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470170_576624>)
A31. No. If you receive virtual currency as a bona fide gift, you will not recognize income until you sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of that virtual currency. For more information about gifts, see [Publication 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-559> "About Publication 559, Survivors, Executors and Administrators").
#### [Q32. How do I determine my basis in virtual currency that I received as a bona fide gift?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470173_389509>)
A32. Your basis in virtual currency received as a bona fide gift differs depending on whether you will have a gain or a loss when you sell or dispose of it. For purposes of determining whether you have a gain, your basis is equal to the donor’s basis, plus any gift tax the donor paid on the gift. For purposes of determining whether you have a loss, your basis is equal to the lesser of the donor’s basis or the fair market value of the virtual currency at the time you received the gift. If you do not have any documentation to substantiate the donor’s basis, then your basis is zero. For more information on basis of property received as a gift, see [Publication 551, Basis of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-551> "About Publication 551, Basis of Assets").
#### [Q33. What is my holding period for virtual currency that I received as a gift?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470175_973888>)
A33. Your holding period in virtual currency received as a gift includes the time that the virtual currency was held by the person from whom you received the gift. However, if you do not have documentation substantiating that person’s holding period, then your holding period begins the day after you receive the gift. For more information on holding periods, see [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-544> "About Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets").
#### [Q34. If I donate virtual currency to a charity, will I have to recognize income, gain, or loss?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470178_212643>)
A34. If you donate virtual currency to a charitable organization described in Internal Revenue Code Section 170(c), you will not recognize income, gain, or loss from the donation. For more information on charitable contributions, see [Publication 526, Charitable Contributions](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-526> "About Publication 526, Charitable Contributions").
#### [Q35. How do I calculate my charitable contribution deduction when I donate virtual currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470180_308924>)
A35. Your charitable contribution deduction is generally equal to the fair market value of the virtual currency at the time of the donation if you have held the virtual currency for more than one year. If you have held the virtual currency for one year or less at the time of the donation, your deduction is the lesser of your basis in the virtual currency or the virtual currency’s fair market value at the time of the contribution. For more information on charitable contribution deductions, see [Publication 526, Charitable Contributions](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-526> "About Publication 526, Charitable Contributions").
#### [Q36. When my charitable organization accepts virtual currency donations, what are my donor acknowledgment responsibilities? (added December 26, 2019)](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470182_639844>)
A36. A charitable organization can assist a donor by providing the contemporaneous written acknowledgment that the donor must obtain if claiming a deduction of $250 or more for the virtual currency donation. See [Publication 1771, Charitable Contributions Substantiation and Disclosure Requirements PDF](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<https:/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1771.pdf> "Publication 1771 PDF"), for more information.
A charitable organization is generally required to sign the donor’s [Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-form-8283> "About Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions"), acknowledging receipt of charitable deduction property if the donor is claiming a deduction of more than $5,000 and if the donor presents the Form 8283 to the organization for signature to substantiate the tax deduction. The signature of the donee on Form 8283 does not represent concurrence in the appraised value of the contributed property. The signature represents acknowledgement of receipt of the property described in Form 8283 on the date specified and that the donee understands the information reporting requirements imposed by section 6050L on dispositions of the donated property (see discussion of Form 8282 in FAQ 37). See [Form 8283 instructions](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</instructions/i8283> "Instructions for Form 8283 \(12/2024\) ") for more information. 
#### [Q37. When my charitable organization accepts virtual currency donations, what are my IRS reporting requirements? (added December 26, 2019)](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470184_740512>)
A37. Charitable organization that receives virtual currency should treat the donation as a noncash contribution. See [Publication 526, Charitable Contributions](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-publication-526> "About Publication 526, Charitable Contributions"), for more information. Tax-exempt charity responsibilities include the following:
  * Charities report non-cash contributions on a Form 990-series annual return and its associated Schedule M, if applicable. Refer to the [Form 990](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-form-990> "About Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax") and Schedule M instructions for more information.
  * Charities must file [Form 8282, Donee Information Return](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-form-8282> "About Form 8282, Donee Information Return \(Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Donated Property\)"), if they sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of charitable deduction property (or any portion thereof) - such as the sale of virtual currency for real currency as described in [FAQ 4](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#faq4>) - within three years after the date they originally received the property and give the original donor a copy of the form. See the instructions on [Form 8282](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/</forms-pubs/about-form-8282> "About Form 8282, Donee Information Return \(Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Donated Property\)") for more information. 


#### [Q38. Will I have to recognize income, gain, or loss if I own multiple digital wallets, accounts, or addresses capable of holding virtual currency and transfer my virtual currency from one to another?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470186_974889>)
A38. No. If you transfer virtual currency from a wallet, address, or account belonging to you, to another wallet, address, or account that also belongs to you, then the transfer is a non-taxable event, even if you receive an information return from an exchange or platform as a result of the transfer.
#### [Q39. I own multiple units of one kind of virtual currency, some of which were acquired at different times and have different basis amounts. If I sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of some units of that virtual currency, can I choose which units are deemed sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470189_939632>)
A39. Yes. You may choose which units of virtual currency are deemed to be sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of if you can specifically identify which unit or units of virtual currency are involved in the transaction and substantiate your basis in those units.
#### [Q40. How do I identify a specific unit of virtual currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470191_378572>)
A40. You may identify a specific unit of virtual currency either by documenting the specific unit’s unique digital identifier such as a private key, public key, and address, or by records showing the transaction information for all units of a specific virtual currency, such as Bitcoin, held in a single account, wallet, or address. This information must show (1) the date and time each unit was acquired, (2) your basis and the fair market value of each unit at the time it was acquired, (3) the date and time each unit was sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, and (4) the fair market value of each unit when sold, exchanged, or disposed of, and the amount of money or the value of property received for each unit.
#### [Q41. How do I account for a sale, exchange, or other disposition of units of virtual currency if I do not specifically identify the units?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470194_422675>)
A41. If you do not identify specific units of virtual currency, the units are deemed to have been sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of in chronological order beginning with the earliest unit of the virtual currency you purchased or acquired; that is, on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis.
#### [Q42. If I engage in a transaction involving virtual currency but do not receive a payee statement or information return such as a Form W-2 or Form 1099, when must I report my income, gain, or loss on my federal income tax return?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470196_650058>)
A42. You must report income, gain, or loss from all taxable transactions involving virtual currency on your Federal income tax return for the taxable year of the transaction, regardless of the amount or whether you receive a payee statement or information return.
#### [Q43. Where do I report my capital gain or loss from virtual currency?](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/<#collapseCollapsible1717616470198_720852>)

With a federal tax revenue gap of about $688 billion, studies suggest that at least $50 billion of that gap is due to unreported digital asset transactions. Given the anonymity of digital asset transactions that involve a trillion-dollar industry, Congress and the IRS created new rules and regulations for reporting information on digital asset sales, exchanges, and transfers, as well as reporting the income from those transactions. The legislative and administrative changes are expected to reduce the tax gap and improve compliance among high-income individuals.
## What are digital assets?
In general, a “digital asset” is any digital representation of value that is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger (or any similar technology) that is not cash.
Some examples of digital assets are:
  * Cryptocurrencies
  * Stablecoins
  * Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)


## How does the federal tax code treat digital assets?
If a particular asset has the characteristics of a digital asset, it will be treated as a digital asset for federal income tax purposes. Digital assets are treated as property for federal tax purposes. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to digital asset transactions.
## What reporting requirements apply to digital asset transactions?
Generally, there are two types of reporting requirements involving digital assets:
  1. Taxpayers must report income resulting from digital asset transactions.
  2. Brokers must report information involving digital asset sales, exchanges, or transfers completed on behalf of their customers.


### 1. Taxpayers must report income derived from digital asset transactions
All income resulting from digital asset transactions must generally be reported on one of the following forms:
  * [Form 1040, Individual Income Tax Return](https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-taxation-regulations/<https:/www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040>)
  * [Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors](https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-taxation-regulations/<https:/www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-sr>)
  * [Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return](https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-taxation-regulations/<https:/www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-nr>)
  * [Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts](https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-taxation-regulations/<https:/www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1041>)
  * [Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income](https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-taxation-regulations/<https:/www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1065>)
  * [Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return](https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-taxation-regulations/<https:/www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1120>)
  * [Form 1120-S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation](https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-taxation-regulations/<https:/www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1120-s>)


Each form essentially asks taxpayers whether they, at any time during the taxable year, either:
  1. Received a digital asset (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services) or
  2. Sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)


The question must be answered “Yes” or “No” by all taxpayers, not just by those who were involved in a digital asset transaction that year. Typically, taxpayers check “Yes” if they did any of the following:
  * Received digital assets as payment for property or services provided
  * Received digital assets resulting from a reward or award
  * Received new digital assets resulting from mining, staking, and similar activities
  * Received digital assets resulting from a hard fork (a branching of a cryptocurrency’s blockchain that splits a single cryptocurrency into two)
  * Disposed of digital assets in exchange for property or services
  * Disposed of a digital asset in exchange or trade for another digital asset
  * Sold a digital asset
  * Otherwise disposed of any other financial interest in a digital asset


#### Examples of reporting income from digital asset transactions:
  * If a taxpayer disposed of any digital asset that was held as a capital asset through a sale, trade, exchange, payment, or other transfer, the taxpayer must complete Form 8949 to calculate their capital gain or loss and report that gain or loss on Schedule D (Form 1040).
  * If a taxpayer received any digital asset as compensation for services or disposed of any digital asset that was held for sale to customers in a trade or business, the taxpayer must report the income as any taxpayer would report other income of the same type (for example, W-2 wages on Form 1040 or inventory or services on Schedule C).


### 2. Brokers must typically report information on digital asset sales, exchanges, or transfers effected on behalf of customers
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 clarified and expanded the rules mainly under §[6045](https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-taxation-regulations/<https:/www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/document/1?citation=26%20usc%206045&summary=yes#jcite>) of how brokers must report information on certain digital asset transactions. The IRS issued proposed and final regulations implementing those rules.
The final regulations under §6045 require U.S. custodial brokers to make information returns and furnish payee statements for certain sales and exchanges of digital assets by filing soon-to-be-released Form 1099-DA, _Digital Asset Proceeds From Broker Transactions_.
A broker is any person who in the ordinary course of a trade or business stands ready to effect sales made by others. Digital asset brokers include:
  * U.S. custodial digital asset trading platforms
  * U.S. processors of digital asset payments
  * U.S. digital asset-hosted wallet providers
  * U.S. digital asset kiosks


U.S. real estate reporting persons facilitating real estate transactions in which digital assets are paid by the buyer in full or partial consideration for the real estate are also digital asset brokers.
On Form 1099-DA, brokers must report gross proceeds on certain sales of digital assets effected for customers beginning for sales of digital assets effected on or after Jan. 1, 2025. Brokers must report basis for those transactions occurring on or after Jan. 1, 2026, but only for digital assets the customer acquired from, and held with, the same broker on or after Jan. 1, 2026. Also, for dispositions of digital assets for real property, brokers must report certain information on those transactions on or after Jan. 1, 2026.
The IRS issued transitional guidance and penalty relief generally for calendar years 2025 and 2026 regarding certain digital asset broker information reporting requirements and for the payment of backup withholding tax required to be withheld, as well as from penalties for brokers who fail to pay that tax for such reportable sales of digital assets.
## Federal taxation vs. international taxation of digital assets
To coordinate this Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) implementation with the rules for non-U.S. brokers, the IRS will require non-U.S. brokers to report information on U.S. customers following a framework for the automatic exchange of crypto-assets information between countries developed by the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)](https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-taxation-regulations/<https:/pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/beps-the-oecd-taxation-of-the-digital-economy/>), to which the U.S. is a party. Using this framework, the IRS would provide information on foreign persons for whom U.S. brokers effect sales of digital assets to other countries that have implemented the CARF and receive information from those countries about transactions by U.S. persons with non-U.S. digital asset brokers.
## State taxation vs. federal taxation of digital assets
At the state level, crypto taxation brings with it another important consideration: sales tax. However, most states do not yet have guidance or [legislation on sales tax](https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-taxation-regulations/<https:/pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/corporate-tax-planning/cryptocurrency-tax-laws-by-state/>). Of the few states that do, some, such as California and Kentucky, treat crypto as equivalent to cash in transactions, and tax it according to the same standard. In other states, such as Arkansas and Washington, digital currencies aren’t subject to taxes.

#  Legal Issues Surrounding Cryptocurrency 
## Legal Issues Surrounding Cryptocurrency
Public interest in Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, has recently surged as multiple industries have been exploring how to capitalize off the new technology. As public interests increase, new uses for cryptos develop almost every day. As new uses of cryptocurrencies emerge, so too do its potential legal liabilities. In this article, we take a look at some common legal issues related to cryptocurrencies.
## **Contractual Issues**
One of [blockchain](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/freemanlaw.com/blockchain-technology-explained-what-is-blockchain-and-how-does-it-work-2/> "blockchain") technology and cryptocurrencies’ most striking features is their self-executing “smart contracts.” Smart contracts are a set of promises, usually specified in a digital format, that act as the basis upon which the parties in a transaction fulfill their specific promises. A [smart contract](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/freemanlaw.com/smart-contracts/> "smart contract") automatically pays the other party when they perform their contractual duties. Due to smart contracts’ unique nature and inherent complexity, whether they fit into the legal framework of traditional contract law is difficult to determine.
The United States has no federal contract law that applies to the country as a whole. Accordingly, contract law varies from state to state. Plus, as of October 2020, no federal law or guidance explicitly defines smart contracts’ or their legal validity. The only exception is the  _Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act_ of 2000, which provides limited legal validity to smart contracts. Since smart contracts’ legal validity is unclear, however, they are likely to result in lengthy litigation processes.
## **Jurisdictional Issues**
The main idea behind [blockchain](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/> "blockchain") technology that underpins cryptocurrencies is that it involves no way to pinpoint a ledger’s actual location. Accordingly, transactions conducted on [blockchain](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/> "blockchain") offer greater privacy than transactions conducted on traditional platforms. But this advantage poses a complex jurisdictional challenge. First, since the nodes of a crypto transaction are located in different jurisdictions, they may be subject to conflicting legal frameworks. Second, the “residence country” for cryptocurrency software is difficult to determine due to the ledger’s lack of a physical location. Third, [blockchain](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/> "blockchain")’s transnational nature makes determining applicable laws and selecting the correct jurisdiction for blockchain disputes exceedingly difficult. For any national regulator, enforcing laws among [blockchain](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/> "blockchain") users, transactions, or projects is a herculean task because of the technology’s cross-border reach.
## **Data Theft and Financial Fraud**
Data theft and financial fraud are additional pressing legal concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies. The blockchain’s promise of anonymity—and its apparent freedom from regulations—can entice many users who are involved in illegal activities to use cryptocurrencies for their financial transactions.
In 2017, a [researcher](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-the-ether-thief/>) at Cornell University identified a serious security flaw in the Ethereum blockchain that put $250 million at risk of theft. Similarly, crypto wallet maker Ledger recently [compromised](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-ledger-email-addresses-data-theft>) 1 million email addresses in a data security breach. Access to the personal information—such as full names, postal addresses, and phone numbers—of Ledger’s 9,500 customers was also stolen. Whether existing data laws can address data theft and financial fraud originating from cryptocurrencies remains unclear.
## **Privacy Concerns**
Privacy concerns are closely related to data theft in the cryptocurrency space. As we’ve seen, one of the main reasons for introducing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin was to provide anonymity in transactions between users. However, Chainalysis showed this anonymity to be threatened by the continuous improvement in [blockchain](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/> "blockchain") analytic tools. The blockchain analytics firm [claimed](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/cointelegraph.com/news/chainalysis-can-now-track-your-privacy-coins-zcash-dash>) that it can trace the vast majority of Zcash and Dash transactions, making “privacy coins” a misnomer.
The United States has no comprehensive federal data protection framework. Instead, sector-specific privacy and data security laws and regulations apply—such as the  _Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act_ , the  _Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act_ (HIPAA), and the  _California Consumer Privacy Act_ (CCPA). The United States’ existing privacy and data security laws and regulations do not address the privacy concerns that have arisen due to [blockchain](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/</cryptocurrency/> "blockchain") technology. For example, [blockchain](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/</cryptocurrency/> "blockchain") technology’s distributed peer-to-peer network architecture is widely considered to contradict the CCPA’s traditional notion of a centralized, controller-based data processing system. In other words, the CCPA’s assumption of centralized controller-based processing is inapplicable to cryptocurrencies because it disregards the decentralized nature of the new technology.
## **Money Laundering**
Several commentators suggest that cryptocurrencies provide criminal organizations with a new way to commit fraud, money laundering, and a host of other financial crimes. This criticism stems from cryptocurrency traders’ ability to remain totally anonymous. Indeed, cryptocurrencies have been used for “dark-market sites,” where criminals can buy and sell illegal items with little chance of being identified. In fact, various governmental agencies have labeled drug dealers that exchange drugs for cryptocurrency as the “new generation of criminals.”
In 2019, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis [estimated](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/www.technologyreview.com/2020/01/16/130843/cryptocurrency-money-laundering-exchanges/#:~:text=Expand%20menu-,Criminals%20laundered%20%242.8%20billion%20in%202019%20using%20crypto%20exchanges%2C%20finds,to%20blockchain%20analytics%20firm%20Chainalysis>) that criminal entities transacted $2.8 billion in Bitcoin exchanges, up from around $1 billion in 2018. Before criminals can convert their illegally acquired cryptocurrency into cash, they have to convert it into liquid cash. The popular exchanges for this conversion are subject to anti-money-laundering rules that require firms to identify their customers. But Chainalysis researchers suggested that criminals have found a way to circumvent these rules using over-the-counter trading (OTC).
## **Tax Implications**
For US federal income tax purposes, cryptocurrencies are property—not currency. This distinction means that US taxpayers cannot use cryptocurrency as a functional currency for  _Internal Revenue Code_ purposes. However, US taxpayers are obligated to report transactions involving cryptocurrencies in US dollars on their annual tax returns. This requirement means that US taxpayers should determine their cryptocurrencies’ fair market value (by converting the virtual currency into US dollars) on each transaction date. As a result, properly reporting cryptocurrencies to the IRS is burdensome for individual taxpayers because they must diligently record the price at which their cryptocurrencies were bought and sold.
Moreover, the United States classifies cryptocurrencies as capital assets. Therefore, individual investors are liable to pay capital gains taxes on any profits they realize via cryptocurrencies. This obligation applies whether or not investors purchased their cryptocurrency from the United States or from another country. Nevertheless, whether US investors who purchased their crypto holdings on foreign exchanges are required to fulfill additional reporting requirements in filing their taxes remains unclear.
## **Intellectual Property**
Cryptocurrencies are becoming rather popular among intellectual property (IP)–intensive sectors, including the pharmaceutical, automotive, luxury, and consumer goods industries, where goods’ traceability is important, and counterfeit or “gray” goods are a concern. The use of cryptocurrencies in IP-intensive industries raises concerns about: (1) IP ownership and authorship, (2) controlling and tracking the distribution of registered or unregistered IPs, and (3) establishing and enforcing IP agreements, licenses, or exclusive distribution networks through smart contracts. For example, considerable uncertainty surrounds who exactly owns [blockchain](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/> "blockchain") technologies and cryptocurrencies.
## **Legal and Regulatory Concerns for Investors**
Since February 2020, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been legal in the United States—and in most other developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada. However, although the IRS considers Bitcoin and other virtual currencies legal, some concerns still surround their legal validity.
Cryptocurrencies are not backed by any centralized issuing authority and intrinsic goods, such as gold or silver, do not underly cryptocurrencies’ value. Instead, their value totally depends upon the value that other owners and investors ascribe to them. Since they are not backed by any centralized regulatory body, investors may have few legal resources if any complications arise from their crypto transactions or ownership.
**Conclusion**
The above legal challenges facing cryptocurrencies are likely to become even more pronounced because no intermediary or authority has the exclusive jurisdiction to settle cryptocurrency-related disputes. For example, in a traditional financial transaction, if a party claims that their account credentials were stolen and that money was fraudulently transferred from their account, their financial institution (such as a bank) can serve as an intermediary and resolve the matter. However, if a parallel situation occurs on a [blockchain](https://freemanlaw.com/legal-issues-surrounding-cryptocurrency/<https:/freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/> "blockchain") platform, no mechanism has been established to settle such a dispute because cryptocurrency is decentralized and has no financial institutions that act as intermediaries. Accordingly, victims of cryptocurrency theft will likely have no legal avenue to compensate for their losses.

Over the last few years, cryptocurrencies have hit the headlines mainly because of their ups and downs on global markets. For example, in 2021 Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s tweets caused several sharp rises and falls of Dogecoin. A government’s attitude also affects the price of cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, China cracked down on cryptocurrency, which led to a sharp price decline.[1](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000010> "link to footnote") The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies significantly among countries, but El Salvador is the only country that recognizes Bitcoin as legal tender. According to CoinMarketCap, as of October 31, there were 13,334 cryptocurrencies and 424 exchanges, and the market cap of cryptocurrencies had reached 2 trillion, illustrating their increasing mainstream use.
Cryptocurrency is characterized not only by hefty price fluctuations but also by continuous innovations. Facebook unveiled its Libra encrypted cryptocurrency program in June 2019.[2](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000012> "link to footnote") Facebook’s high user base gives it a unique position to make Libra a real force in this increasingly cashless world and even compete with banks. Further, Facebook’s global infrastructure allows it to handle 1,000 transactions a second, compared with just seven a second for Bitcoin. Libra’s launch might raise concerns, especially for banks, which fear lower revenues from cross-border payments.
With cryptocurrencies, it is possible to achieve high price gains, which tax authorities want to tax. But it is unclear how cryptocurrencies should be treated for income tax purposes, and several issues are associated with cryptocurrencies: First and foremost, taxpayers may not properly identify income earned through cryptocurrencies as taxable income. Even if they are aware that they might have a tax liability, they may be uncertain about the proper treatment. For example, cryptocurrency transactions might be considered barter transactions, which have special requirements for reporting and paying tax. Also, calculating the basis for any taxable gain may be difficult. Moreover, because crypto transactions are inherently hard to track, including identifying the true parties to the transaction, third-party information reporting may be difficult or prohibitively burdensome for some cryptocurrency issuers to administer.[3](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000014> "link to footnote") Finally, tax evasion can be a problem. Because transactions can be difficult to trace and many cryptocurrencies offer some level of anonymity, taxpayers might use them to hide taxable income.[4](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000016> "link to footnote")
This article attempts to answer some questions regarding the taxation of cryptocurrencies by describing their general characteristics and how countries treat crypto trading and mining for income tax purposes. It concludes that the absence of concrete cryptocurrency rules will lead to the heterogeneous treatment of similar cases and should be remedied immediately.
## I. General Cryptocurrency Characteristics
Cryptocurrency is unregulated digital money that does not exist in the form of legal tender — that is, banknotes and coins — but solely as electronic codes in computer systems. Further, there is no central instance — that is, a central bank — that can issue and control them.
### A. Crypto and Virtual Currencies
There are many different virtual currency schemes; the most relevant characteristic for taxation is the currency’s interactions with legal tender and the real economy. Accordingly, the European Central Bank has grouped virtual currencies into three categories.[5](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000018> "link to footnote") First, closed virtual currency schemes have no link to the real economy and cannot be used outside a specific virtual community. Those are not a new phenomenon — consider Monopoly and other board games that feature in-game money. For tax purposes, closed virtual currency schemes are not relevant because they cannot interact with the real economy.[6](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000020> "link to footnote") Second, virtual currency schemes with a unidirectional flow can be purchased using real currency but cannot be exchanged back to the original currency. And third, virtual currency schemes with a used-as-consideration bidirectional flow can be bought and sold according to special exchange rates with real currency.[7](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000022> "link to footnote")
There are two types of bidirectional virtual currencies. First is virtual money that can be used in only one specific online game or community. For example, the Linden Dollar is unique to the online game Second Life, which has its own virtual economy.[8](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000024> "link to footnote") Players can use the Linden Dollar to buy and sell goods and services. Linden Dollars can be purchased with legal tender and changed back to legal tender when they are no longer needed or at any time at the discretion of the gamer.[9](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000026> "link to footnote") Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life, is responsible for issuing Linden Dollars and controls the virtual currency system.
The second type of bidirectional virtual currency is virtual money that can be used to acquire goods and services in the real economy — commonly called cryptocurrency.[10](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000028> "link to footnote") Cryptocurrencies are not linked to any specific virtual reality, nor are they issued by any central authority. They are most similar to other convertible currencies because they can be acquired and sold in exchange for legal tender and used as consideration for traditional goods and services.[11](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000030> "link to footnote") The most well-known example of cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which has attracted the attention of various scholars in the field of direct and indirect taxation.[12](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000032> "link to footnote")
This article examines cryptocurrencies only.
### B. Cryptocurrencies and Legal Tender
In general, it is unclear whether cryptocurrencies should be treated similarly to legal tender or as assets. According to the European Central Bank, legal tender has three core features:
  * it can be used as a medium of exchange to avoid the inconveniences of a barter system;
  * it can be used as a unit of account, acting as a standard numerical unit for simplifying the measurement of value and costs; and
  * it can be used for storing value when money is saved and retrieved in the future.[13](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000034> "link to footnote")


The EU’s Electronic Money Directive (2009/110/EC) defines the term:
> “Electronic money” means electronically, including magnetically, stored monetary value as represented by a claim on the issuer which is issued on receipt of funds for the purpose of making payment transactions . . . and which is accepted by a natural or legal person other than the electronic money issuer.
By referring to the function of money, which is to facilitate trade in the economy, the Court of Justice of the European Union has said the key characteristic of money is to use it as a means of payment in the real economy.[14](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000036> "link to footnote")
The European Central Bank’s criteria for legal tender are general criteria that apply for all types of legal tender globally. Based on the bank’s definition, it seems that cryptocurrencies should be treated similarly to legal tender because they are used for the same functions.[15](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000038> "link to footnote")
## II. Key Taxable Crypto Events
### A. Creation of Cryptocurrencies
The creation of cryptocurrencies is the first taxable event. Cryptocurrencies may be created by mining or initial airdrops or coin offerings. Cryptocurrencies received via airdrops may be of little value, so tax compliance would not raise much concern.
Mining, which describes what can be called the creation of crypto from legal tender, has attracted the most attention from tax policymakers. Because cryptocurrencies are unrelated to any virtual game or community and there is no central authority responsible for supervising and issuing, this unique way of creating units of cryptocurrencies is substantially different from legal tender.
Cryptocurrencies are based on a peer-to-peer network; anyone can download the free and open-source software and participate in the network. The software allows cryptocurrency to be stored in a digital wallet on the computer.[16](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000040> "link to footnote") Because cryptocurrencies exist only electronically, spending them means transmitting them from one user’s electronic wallet to another’s. That is similar to sending money from one bank account to another. The payment process is generally protected by special encryption software.[17](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000042> "link to footnote")
Because there is no central authority, users must perform all the tasks of a central bank themselves. Thus, when a payment is made, servers of other users must confirm that the transaction is valid by verifying that the specific currency token was not copied, forged, or spent more than once. Technically, each payment transaction is broadcasted to the central network and included in a public ledger that records which units have already been spent. For every transaction, the software produces a unique code (hash) and publishes it so that it takes its (chronological) place in the blockchain.
Hashing leads to one-way codiﬁcation of the data — that is, data cannot be de-codified. A transaction’s place in the blockchain becomes definitive once the transaction is verified. A set number of transactions is grouped together and, by solving an algorithm, creates a new block of the cryptocurrency. That mining process requires extremely fast and powerful computers. Users provide mining services to receive new units of the cryptocurrency as a reward for their server activities.[18](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000044> "link to footnote")
Mining for new crypto units resembles the mining of other commodities, such as gold or copper. Over time, new units of the cryptocurrency are slowly made available, but as the number of tokens in circulation grows, the computing power required for verifying transactions increases, and a miner’s reward with new tokens decreases.[19](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000046> "link to footnote") Still, the analogy to scarce and precious commodities might be misleading. The fact that new tokens are created is a mechanism to provide for the security and safety of the system because it encourages users to act honestly. Technically, more computer power would be needed to steal existing tokens than to mine new ones.[20](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000048> "link to footnote") Even so, the absolute number of tokens is limited, so that at some point, new units can no longer be created.[21](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000050> "link to footnote") Therefore, mining will eventually be rewarded only with transaction fees paid by the parties who engage in the transaction.
### B. Cryptocurrency Disposal
The disposal of cryptocurrencies is also likely to lead to a taxable event, with three acts involving cryptocurrencies having possible tax implications: exchanging legal tender for cryptocurrency, exchanging one cryptocurrency for another, and exchanging goods and services for crypto. Cryptocurrency is mostly used as an investment vehicle, so its exchange with legal tender and other cryptocurrencies has become the most common disposal activity, and the income generated in the process may give rise to income tax.[22](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000052> "link to footnote")
With the expansion of the market value of Bitcoin and the improvement of market recognition, more and more enterprises have recognized it as a valid form of payment, which might also raise income tax issues.
## III. Country Overview
The following subsections overview the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies by a sample of countries and serve as a way to filter out similarities and best practices.
### A. Australia
The Australian Taxation Office has provided detailed and regularly updates guidance on the tax treatment of cryptocurrency. All documents are published on the ATO website and contain multiple examples and references to sources in which additional information on specific topics can be found.
In Australia, the income tax treatment of cryptocurrency depends on whether the currency is held for business, investment, or private purposes. If crypto is kept or used mainly to purchase items for personal use or consumption, it may be a personal use asset. It is not a personal use asset if it is kept or used mainly as an investment, in a profit-making scheme, or in carrying on a business, so the taxpayer has to pay tax on any capital gain he makes on its disposal. Only capital gains that taxpayers make from personal use assets acquired for less than $10,000 are disregarded for capital gains tax purposes. However, all capital losses taxpayers make on personal use assets are disregarded.[23](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000054> "link to footnote")
If mining is a business activity, any cryptocurrency generated is treated as trading stock income, and changes in the value of trading stock throughout the year are included in income or losses. If the mining is not carried out as part of a business activity, the mined cryptocurrencies are taxed first under the CGT regime on disposal.[24](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000056> "link to footnote")
The ATO’s guidance includes a brief reference to airdrops, stating that the creator of a new block is rewarded with additional tokens when the new block is created. The additional tokens are received from holding the original tokens, and their monetary value is ordinary income of the creator when they are derived.
The ATO guidance also explains the tax treatment of new cryptocurrency received as a result of a chain split, with the treatment depending on whether the new currency is held as an investment or in a business carried on by the holder. In general, new tokens resulting from a chain split are treated similarly to those obtained through mining, with additional considerations in determining whether the cryptocurrency is a new asset or a continuation of the original.[25](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000058> "link to footnote")
### B. Brazil
The Brazilian Federal Revenue Service recently issued guidance for investing in cryptocurrencies.[26](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000060> "link to footnote") According to this guidance, cryptocurrencies are not deemed as legal tender, but rather as a financial asset.
According to the rules for financial assets, the purchase and ownership of cryptocurrency must be reported to Brazilian tax authorities on an individual’s annual income tax return. Each type of cryptocurrency must be reported separately at cost basis. Generally, the cost basis is the purchase price of the asset, so the taxpayer needs to provide information on that price. Appreciation needs to be reported only when realized, and capital gains realized from the sale will be subject to a tax rate of 15 to 22.5 percent, depending on the amount of income. Capital losses resulting from the sale of cryptocurrencies cannot be offset.
Offshore investments that exceed the value of $100,000 held by Brazilian residents must be reported and disclosed to the Brazilian Central Bank. It is unclear whether cryptocurrencies can be regarded as offshore investments and if so, under what circumstances.
The Federal Revenue Service guidance does not address crypto barter transactions or mining. Even so, under general tax principles, if a taxpayer buys a good or service or another cryptocurrency with cryptocurrency, that should be treated like a barter transaction.[27](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000062> "link to footnote") Accordingly, if the taxpayer acquired a cryptocurrency and it appreciated, the taxable gain consists of the difference between the crypto’s market value and cost basis.
In Brazil, it is unclear whether a taxpayer providing mining services receives income from those services. That might hold true for transaction fees, which the miner receives, and they should be taxed the same way as gross income.
Another view could apply to the newly mined tokens: The miner could be treated as someone conducting self-work, such as an artist, who does not realize any taxable income during the production phase.[28](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000064> "link to footnote") Accordingly, only on disposition of the new token will there be taxable gain.
Brazil has a monthly de minimis income tax exemption for sales of assets realizing less than BRL 35,000 (about $6,190). The threshold includes the total sale value of all assets realized in a given month; if the amount is below it, gains arising from the sales will not be taxed. According to the Brazilian tax authorities, cryptocurrencies fall under the tax exemption. Brazilian investors with more than BRL 5,000 worth of cryptocurrency must report the funds on their income tax declarations.[29](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000066> "link to footnote") Even so, any realization events should be indicated on the taxpayer’s annual return.
The combined Brazilian rate for corporate income tax and for social contributions is 34 percent, and all corporate profits and gains are taxed at that rate. Similar to individual taxation, gains and losses should be taxed only on realization.
The Brazilian transaction tax on foreign exchange transactions likely does not apply to transactions exchanging legal tender into cryptocurrency. Thus, it is assumed that cryptocurrency can be used to circumvent foreign exchange tax. For example, if Brazilian real is directly converted to Chinese yuan renminbi, the tax on currency transactions applies. If, however, Brazilian real is converted into cryptocurrency that is then converted into Chinese yuan renminbi, it is likely that no foreign exchange tax can be levied. However, the Brazilian Central Bank said in November 2017 that international money transfers must be made through official channels.[30](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000068> "link to footnote") In other words, if cryptocurrency is used, it also needs to be done via official channels, which might lead to a situation in which foreign exchange tax would still apply.
### C. Germany
Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) defines cryptocurrencies as financial instruments.[31](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000070> "link to footnote") In accordance with the German banking act, crypto is a form of private money, and although it is not considered legal tender, some rules applicable to foreign currencies also apply to it.
The federal tax authorities have provided no guidance on the income tax treatment of cryptocurrencies. The tax authorities of North Rhine-Westphalia have issued guidance on how to tax individuals on their investments in and mining of cryptocurrencies.[32](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000072> "link to footnote") In general, cryptocurrencies are treated as intangible assets, so their acquisition and disposal could lead to income from private sales transactions that will be taxed if the period between acquisition and disposal does not exceed one year. The exchange of one cryptocurrency into another also triggers the same taxation as the exchange into legal tender or the use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment (barter transaction).
If several acquisitions and sales transactions were made at different times, the first-in, first-out method should be applied.
When the sum of all private sales transactions — including crypto sales — does not exceed the exemption limit of €600 in the respective calendar year, the income is tax exempt. Once the exemption limit has been exceeded, all profits are taxable. Losses incurred on the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies may be offset only against profits from other private sale transactions in the same calendar year. They may also be carried back to the immediately preceding calendar year or forward indefinitely and be offset only against profits from private sale transactions.
The tax authorities regularly assume that mined tokens and any proceeds thereof constitute income from business operations because of the required initial investments (such as high computing power and increasingly complex cryptographic tasks). If cryptocurrencies are traded as part of a commercial activity, any proceeds are taxed under the rules of trade and business profits, irrespective of whether the crypto was held more or less than one year. Regardless of whether the income is generated from private sales transactions or from a trade or business, the marginal tax rate ranges from 0 to 45 percent.
The tax authorities asked miners to report cases of commercial crypto mining and provide information on possible difficulties in determining the facts, as well as the amount of profit or loss. Under the EU anti-money-laundering (AML) directive ((EU) 2015/849), respective AML obligations apply to cryptocurrency exchange and digital wallet service providers.
In June the Federal Ministry of Finance published a draft of instructions for reporting the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies that summarizes the tax events in each operational link of cryptocurrency and the relevant tax rules, including traditional and emerging problems, such as mining and disposal.[33](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000074> "link to footnote")
### D. India
Cryptocurrencies are neither authorized nor regulated by any central authority in India. In 2018 the Reserve Bank of India prohibited banks and other financial institutions from engaging in any crypto-related activities. In early 2020 the Supreme Court reversed the order, allowing cryptocurrency trading. It is unclear whether cryptocurrencies are illegal in India. There are no rules for how to tax them, so the following analysis is based on an interpretation of general Indian tax rules.
Cryptocurrencies may be regarded as capital assets or stock in trade. If considered capital assets, buying and selling cryptocurrencies will lead to capital gains. Depending on the holding period — that is, either less or more than 36 months — the gains might be either short- or long-term. In general, long-term gains are taxed at approximately 20 percent, and short-term gains are taxed at 25 to 30 percent.[34](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000076> "link to footnote") If the taxpayer trades in cryptocurrencies with comparably short holding periods of just several days to a few months,[35](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000078> "link to footnote") they could be held as stock in trade. If so, it might be possible to tax income from a transfer or sale as business income.
Some observers think using crypto as a means of payment should not be regarded as a barter transaction and that the cryptocurrency represents a fiat currency.[36](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000080> "link to footnote") Accordingly, only the underlying transaction (the supply of a good or a service) should be taxed — that is, should lead to business income or capital gains. That view is not convincing. If cryptocurrency is treated as an asset or as stock in trade, paying with it should lead to a realization of either capital gains or business income. Similarly, when receiving it as consideration, the cryptocurrency would need to be activated in the balance sheet. Trading one cryptocurrency against another constitutes trading of assets or stock triggering capital gains or business income.[37](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000082> "link to footnote")
Because there is no official guidance from the Indian tax authorities, it is unclear how mining cryptocurrencies should be treated. It still needs to be determined when tax should be due: When the cryptocurrency is mined or when it is sold? If the answer is not when mined, the income would be characterized as business income and taxed under Chapter IV-D of the Income Tax Act, 1961.[38](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000084> "link to footnote") Even so, it seems more likely that mining can be treated similarly to the production of assets, which would lead to capital gains taxation under Chapter IV-E of the ITA. The capital gain is the sales proceeds less the cost of acquisition, but it is still unclear how the cost of acquisition should be calculated and thus whether a capital gains tax can be computed at all.
### E. Singapore
In April 2020 the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore issued guidance on the income tax treatment of cryptocurrency.[39](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000086> "link to footnote") Because there is no capital gains tax in Singapore, any gains derived from long-term crypto investments are not subject to tax. Depending on the trading frequency and holding periods, those gains could also be characterized as trading gains and would be subject to corporate income tax.
The miner’s profits will be taxed on disposal of the payment token instead of on mining it: Although miners are entitled to a right to own a payment token when they successfully mine, simply holding cryptocurrency does not enable them to earn income. The income of a company engaging in mining activities for profit will be regarded as trade income, so the company will be taxed on profits when it sells the mined token, and the mining expenses can be deducted. If an individual engages in mining activities as a hobby, capital gains from the sale of the mined tokens are not taxable.
The guidance also stipulates the income tax treatment for airdrop and hard forks. It defines an airdrop as the distribution of tokens for free for marketing purposes. If the airdrop was not given in return for any goods or services, it is not taxable. It would not be regarded as income subject to tax, but the gains from the subsequent disposal would be taxable. The guidance defines a hard fork as splitting a cryptocurrency to create a second cryptocurrency that operates separately from and alongside the original. Owners of the existing cryptocurrency might receive a second token for free, and the recipient will be taxed at the point of disposal instead of at the point of receipt.
### F. South Africa
In 2018 the [South African Revenue Service said](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/</lr/resolve/27y7v>) it will apply normal income tax rules to cryptocurrencies. Unlike other countries, South Africa has not released a separate interpretation on how to tax crypto; depending on the nature of the transaction, taxpayers can seek guidance through channels such as binding private rulings.
South Africa does not regard cryptocurrency as legal tender or a standard unit for payment but as an intangible asset. Following the South African income tax rules, income derived from cryptocurrency transactions should be taxed on the revenue account as gross income. Alternatively, it may also be taxed as capital gain.
### G. The United Kingdom
In December 2018 HM Revenue & Customs released a paper detailing cryptocurrency tax guidelines for individuals,[40](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000088> "link to footnote") in November 2019 it published its policy paper on the tax treatment of cryptocurrency for companies and other businesses, and in 2021 it integrated and updated those policy documents and issued a cryptocurrency manual.
The guidance focuses not only on cryptocurrencies but also on other types of tokens. HMRC said it will provide further guidance on the tax treatment of cryptoasset transactions involving businesses and companies.
For individuals who own cryptocurrency for capital appreciation, capital gains tax is due on disposition. Capital gains tax is collected only on assets disposed of for more than £6,000. Disposal is regarded to be everything from using cryptocurrency as a means of payment to exchanging it for other types of crypto or legal tender.
There may be times when an individual is carrying on a business of financial trade in cryptocurrencies and will therefore have taxable trading profits. That is likely to be unusual, but in those cases, income taxation of the trading profits would take priority over the capital gains tax rules.
Any fees or rewards received in return for mining are also subject to income taxation, either as trading or miscellaneous income[41](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000090> "link to footnote") depending on the degree of activity, or the organization, risk, or commerciality. If the awarded tokens are not disposed of immediately, any increase in value will give rise to a chargeable gain on disposal for capital gains tax purposes or, for a trade, get taken into account in computing any trading profits for income tax purposes.
In general, losses can be used to reduce the income tax liability of trading income against future profits or other income. If profits from activities are taxable as miscellaneous income, it might be possible to carry losses forward.
Further, for inheritance taxes, cryptocurrencies will be considered property and not currency or money.
HMRC has asked two cryptocurrency exchanges to provide data, seeking information about U.K. customers, including names, addresses, and transaction data, to ensure tax compliance.[42](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000092> "link to footnote") It has said the collected data are used to improve the integrity of the tax system and identify taxpayers that have failed to declare their gains.
### H. The United States
The United States was one of the first countries to publish administrative guidance on the tax treatment of cryptocurrency transactions. [Notice 2014-21](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/</lr/resolve/1fx2x>), 2014-16 IRB 938, explained how to apply the principles of U.S. taxation to cryptocurrency. In November 2016 the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported ([2016-30-083](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/</lr/resolve/gb3r>)) that the IRS should formulate more detailed cryptocurrency tax rules. IRS [Notice 2019-21](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/</lr/resolve/297lz>), 2019-14 IRB 1, solved some remaining problems and explained the income tax treatment of hard forks and airdrops.
In 2021 the IRS updated the frequently asked questions on its website, expanding on the examples in Notice 2014-21 and applying long-standing tax principles to additional situations. On August 10 the Senate passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ([H.R. 3684](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/</lr/resolve/7779s>)), which is expected to raise an additional $28 billion in tax revenue from cryptocurrency.
The IRS guidance notes that cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. For U.S. tax purposes, cryptocurrency is treated as property, so it is not possible to generate foreign currency gains or losses with cryptocurrency.
If a taxpayer receives cryptocurrency, that will result in gross income — that is, the taxpayer must include the fair market value of the cryptocurrency, measured in U.S. dollars, as of the date received. Accordingly, when a taxpayer exchanges cryptocurrency for property or legal currency, he may have a gain or loss on the transaction, which is calculated by subtracting the cost basis from the proceeds.
The gain (or loss) can be characterized as capital or ordinary. When a taxpayer invests in cryptocurrency, it is treated as a capital asset and can be considered short- or long-term gain (or loss). In general, capital losses may offset only capital gains, not ordinary income. Long-term capital gains benefit from favorable rates of 0, 15, or 20 percent, while short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. A taxpayer generally realizes ordinary gain or loss on the sale or exchange of cryptocurrency that is not a capital asset in his hands — for example, for inventory and other property held mainly for sale to customers in a trade or business.
When a taxpayer mines cryptocurrency, the FMV as of the date of receipt is includable in gross income. If a taxpayer’s cryptocurrency transactions constitute a trade or business and are not undertaken by the taxpayer as an employee, they constitute self-employment income. Net earnings are calculated as the gross income derived from carrying on a trade or business less allowable deductions. Necessary business expenses can be deducted from self-employment income.
Similarly, cryptocurrency paid by an employer as remuneration for services constitutes wages for employment tax purposes because the medium in which remuneration is paid is immaterial to whether it constitutes a wage. Accordingly, the FMV of cryptocurrency paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding, insurance contribution tax, and unemployment tax and must be reported on the respective wage tax form.
Information reporting applies to the same extent as to any other property transaction, and payments made using cryptocurrency are subject to backup withholding to the same extent as other payments made in property.[43](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000094> "link to footnote") There are also IRS information reporting requirements for a person who settles payments made in cryptocurrency on behalf of merchants that accept cryptocurrency from their customers. By contracting with a substantial number of unrelated merchants to settle payments, the third party must report payments made to a merchant on a specific form.
For hard forks, if a taxpayer did not receive units of the new cryptocurrency from the hard fork, she would not have accession to wealth or have gross income under IRC [section 61](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/</lr/resolve/cqr6> "section 61"). If the taxpayer received new units of cryptocurrency in the airdrop following the hard forks, she has accession to wealth and ordinary income in the tax year in which the new cryptocurrency is received.
In 2018 [the IRS announced a campaign](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<https:/www.irs.gov/businesses/irs-lbi-compliance-campaigns-july-2-2018>) to address tax noncompliance stemming from the use of cryptocurrency through outreach and taxpayer examinations. In 2021 the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California authorized the IRS to issue John Doe summonses to crypto exchange operators Kraken to find users who conducted at least $20,000 of transactions in cryptocurrency from 2016 to 2020. The IRS did the same thing in 2016, when it went after Coinbase cryptocurrency transaction information from 2013 to 2015. The IRS used that information to send letters to taxpayers with crypto transactions that potentially failed to report income and pay the resulting tax or did not report their transactions properly. The letters were meant to help taxpayers understand their tax and filing obligations and how to correct past errors.
The regulations established by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network apply to cryptocurrency trading platforms. The network is responsible for preventing money laundering and terrorist financing.[44](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000096> "link to footnote") Persons engaged in cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings must comply with requirements and rules applicable to AML and combating the financing of terrorism.
### I. Other International Trends
Jurisdictions other than those discussed have also found ways of addressing cryptocurrencies. For example, Japan passed the Virtual Currency Act in early 2017, becoming the first country to recognize cryptocurrency as a legal method of payment.[45](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000098> "link to footnote") Its tax agency has reportedly created a database on cryptocurrency investors, and teams based in Tokyo and Osaka are closely watching electronic trading.[46](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000100> "link to footnote")
In countries where cryptocurrencies can be traded, tax authorities have increased their control over cryptocurrency investors. For example, Australia’s tax authorities collect records from Australian cryptocurrency service providers, including cryptocurrency purchase and sale information, as part of a data-matching program to ensure people trading in cryptocurrency are paying the right amount of tax. Belgium has opened several investigations into citizens who have traded on foreign exchanges.[47](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000102> "link to footnote") In Denmark, which treats gains from speculation with cryptocurrencies as income,[48](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000104> "link to footnote") the tax agency was authorized to obtain from three domestic exchanges tax information on trades or exchanges of fiat currencies for crypto and trades or transfers of one cryptocurrency for another.[49](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000106> "link to footnote") South Korea’s National Tax Service began investigating the country’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, demanding data on financial transactions and related accounting books.[50](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000108> "link to footnote")
Many countries, including Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Iran, Macedonia, Morocco, Nepal, Venezuela, and Vietnam, ban cryptocurrencies.[51](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000110> "link to footnote") Because crypto trading takes place online without banks or governments being involved and cannot be strictly controlled by the authorities, it is unclear to what extent bans are enforced or successful.
As a result of the wide differences in the treatment of cryptocurrencies, calls for international coordination and cooperation among regulators to address risk management measures are growing. Worldwide cooperation could take place at the G-20 level[52](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000112> "link to footnote") or in a framework under the auspices of the IMF.[53](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000114> "link to footnote") In the absence of international cooperation, the European Central Bank may address cryptocurrencies and issue its own regulations. Along those lines, the OECD has recently called for international cooperation on new frameworks for addressing the tax consequences of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, cautioning that they pose risks to gains made in tax transparency in the last decade.[54](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000116> "link to footnote") So far, however, no compromise for harmonized treatment has surfaced.
Emerging issues, such as stable coins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC), could bring about different tax policy implications. Take the stable coin. Facebook’s Libra is the most well-known stable coin project. Whether stable coins should have tax policies similar to classic cryptocurrencies is an important question that policymakers should consider. Further, several countries are considering issuing their own CBDCs. CBDCs and other cryptocurrencies have fundamental differences because CBDCs can be considered legal tender, so countries may want to treat CBDCs similarly to legal tender for tax purposes.[55](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000118> "link to footnote")
## IV. Conclusion
From the country overview, one can see that many countries’ tax authorities are interested in cryptocurrencies. Some have issued guidance on the tax treatment of crypto transactions, and many regard cryptocurrencies as a form of property for income tax purposes. Taxable events include the creation and disposal of cryptocurrencies.
Most countries consider the receipt of a new token via mining, exchanging legal tender for cryptocurrencies, and exchanging cryptocurrencies for others as generating taxable events. Accordingly, trading with and mining cryptocurrencies often leads to income taxation or capital gains taxation. In rare cases, the assets are treated as generating business or miscellaneous income.
However, cryptocurrency treatment is not always clear in some countries. To reduce the level of tax liability unawareness, tax authorities must issue guidance to explain to taxpayers that transacting in digital currencies does not relieve them of tax obligations.
Aside from providing clear guidance, the main challenge tax authorities face seems to be enforcing reporting obligations and tax rules because crypto transactions remain mostly decentralized and anonymous. From studying the practices of Japan, South Korea, and the United States, one can see that tax authorities request the help of trading platforms to enforce tax rules and identify unreported transactions. Like banks, cryptocurrency trading platforms can help obtain customer information and transaction records.
Some countries ban cryptocurrencies because they are concerned about money laundering and the financing of illegal activities.[56](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-federal/income-taxation-of-cryptocurrency-a-country-comparison/<#7ckj8-0000120> "link to footnote") However, those kinds of bans are more likely to cause additional difficulties because unregulated offshore exchange platforms might be used to circumvent them. Those platforms cannot be controlled or supervised by regulatory authorities. Moreover, investors trading or mining via offshore platforms and servers will be less likely to pay any taxes on their crypto income and gains because they are conducting illegal activities.
Rather than banning cryptocurrency, it might be more efficient to pursue tax policies that create tax incentives for investors to report cryptocurrency transactions. One solution would be to offer a preferential capital gains rate for crypto transactions that are reported upfront. By ensuring preferential tax treatment for more cryptocurrency transactions, regulatory agencies might encourage users to report their transactions.
Further, cryptocurrency exchange platforms must be subject to the rules of regulatory authorities and will need to report transactions involving larger sums, allowing countries to reduce the illegal transactions and tax fraud that occur on cryptocurrency exchanges.

### Key Takeaways 
  * In the United States, cryptocurrency is subject to income and capital gains tax.
  * The IRS can trace your crypto transactions — the agency requests prominent exchanges to hand over transaction records and uses blockchain analysis to crack down on tax fraud.
  * To accurately report your cryptocurrency taxes, you’ll need to keep records of all of your cryptocurrency transactions for the year. Alternatively, you can use crypto tax software like CoinLedger to simplify the process.


## When do I owe tax on cryptocurrency? 
In the United States, cryptocurrency is subject to capital gains tax (when you dispose of cryptocurrency) and income tax (when you earn cryptocurrency).
![How is cryptocurrency taxed? ](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/6553611a32fab4ec7dcccb27_62ceaf8d50a22181d5a1c87f_usa-guide1.png)
Here’s a few examples of transactions subject to capital gains tax and income tax. 
**Capital gains tax:** Selling your crypto, trading your crypto for another cryptocurrency, using your crypto to buy goods and services.
**Income tax:** Earning crypto from staking, mining, referrals from an exchange, or as compensation for labor.
## How much is cryptocurrency taxed?
Your [**tax rate**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-rates>) depends on how much you earned during the year and how long you held your cryptocurrency.
### How much tax do I pay on cryptocurrency? 
If you earned cryptocurrency income or disposed of your crypto after less than 12 months of holding, you’ll pay tax between 10-37%.
![US Income tax brackets 2024](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/6734d27c043c4e57a6754a43_6734c8f2b8e35bcd06f086c7_2024%2520Crypto%2520Tax%2520Rates%2520v1%2520infographic%25202.jpeg)
If you dispose of your cryptocurrency after 12 months of holding, you’ll pay tax between 0-20%.
![Long term capital gains tax brackets 2024](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/66a911b18230a41de116ce05_668c312c195ec39411268d12_Crypto%2520Tax%2520Rates%2520UPDATE%2520V1_01%2520\(1\).jpeg)
### How do crypto tax brackets work?
Income earned in the U.S. (including crypto income) isn’t subject to a flat tax rate. Rather, taxpayers pay different tax rates on each individual portion of income as they progress through tax brackets. For example, if a taxpayer has $25,000 of ordinary income for the year, they will pay 10% on the first $11,600 and 12% on the next $13,400.
![Income tax brackets in US 2024](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/6734d27a043c4e57a67548f9_6734c90e105a691d3dde9b43_2024%2520Crypto%2520Tax%2520Rates%2520v1%2520infographic%25203.jpeg)
## When do you owe taxes on your crypto?
You incur a taxable event when you earn or dispose of cryptocurrency.
### When do you owe capital gains tax on cryptocurrency? 
When you dispose of cryptocurrency, you’ll recognize a capital gain or loss depending on how the price of your crypto has changed since you originally received it. 
Here’s a few examples of crypto disposals subject to capital gains tax: 
  * Selling your cryptocurrency
  * Trading it for another crypto 
  * Using crypto to buy goods and services


### Example:
Sean buys $3,000 of BTC.
Later, he sells his BTC for $3,300.
Sean incurs $300 of capital gain.
### When do you owe income tax on cryptocurrency? 
When you earn cryptocurrency, you’ll recognize income based on the fair market value of your crypto at the time of receipt. Examples of income include airdrop rewards, staking rewards, and mining rewards.
## Tax-free cryptocurrency transactions
Not every cryptocurrency transaction is subject to tax! You do not trigger a taxable event when you:
  * Hold cryptocurrency
  * Buy cryptocurrency with fiat currency and hold it
  * Transfer crypto from one wallet you own to another wallet you own
  * Use cryptocurrency as collateral for a loan


![non-taxable events in crypto ](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/655361329a410c0714edb74f_62cedca54741245c4bf39eb0_usa-guide9.png)
## Can the IRS track your cryptocurrency?
![IRS works with contractors to trace blockchain transactions](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/673dfb6ef7c16c285f8694b1_673dfa2b39ce277928265b40_Explainer-Infographic-Remake-v2-infogrpahic-2.jpeg)
It’s often assumed that because cryptocurrency is anonymous, evading taxes is fairly easy. This is not true.
Major exchanges like Coinbase send [**1099 forms**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/crypto-form-1099>) to the IRS which contain your information and records of your crypto income.
The IRS can use the information that it receives from major exchanges to match ‘anonymous’ wallets to known individuals. In the past, the [**agency has worked with contractors like Chainalysis**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/can-the-irs-track-cryptocurrency>) to analyze the blockchain and crack down on tax fraud.
In the near future, the IRS will have even more information at its disposal to identify tax cheats. Due to the passage of the [**Build Back Better Act**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/how-the-2021-infrastructure-bill-impacts-crypto-taxes>), all exchanges will be required to report 1099 forms with detailed records of capital gains and losses starting in 2025.
## What happens if you don’t report your crypto taxes?
The IRS can enforce a number of penalties for tax fraud, including criminal prosecution, five years in prison, and a fine of up to $250,000.
Over the past several years, the IRS has aggressively cracked down on cryptocurrency tax compliance issues. It’s [**updated the main US income tax form**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/irs-crypto-1040-update>) (1040) to include a question that every US taxpayer must answer under penalty of perjury:
_At any time during 2023, did you receive, sell, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?_
As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates, it’s likely that we’ll see more [**cryptocurrency tax audits**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-audits>) and tax prosecutions.
## How do you lower your crypto taxes?
While there’s no way to evade your cryptocurrency taxes, the strategies below can help you legally [**reduce your crypto taxes**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/decrease-crypto-tax>)!
### 1. Hold your cryptocurrency
Holding your cryptocurrency for the long-term comes with tax benefits! When you dispose of crypto held for longer than a year, you pay a lower tax rate on your capital gains.
![Long term vs short term capital gains](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/673dfb6ef7c16c285f8694b4_673dfa6c801522a4048eb7e0_Explainer-Infographic-Remake-v2-infogrpahic-6.jpeg)
### 2. Tax-loss harvesting
Capital losses from cryptocurrency can offset an unlimited amount of capital gains and up to $3,000 of income for the year. Additional losses can be rolled forward into future tax years.Learn more about how you can [**tax loss harvest with cryptocurrency here**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-loss-harvesting>).
![Reduce crypto tax with tax-loss harvesting ](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/655361b2ac9185272113182f_62cee324bbcee84505220b8c_usa-guide12.png)
### 3. Hold cryptocurrency in an IRA
If you’re planning on holding your cryptocurrency for the long-haul, a [**cryptocurrency IRA**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/tools/best-crypto-and-bitcoin-ira>) can be a great option. With a self-directed IRA, you can hold cryptocurrencies and dispose of them on a tax-free/tax-deferred basis once you’re near retirement age.
### 4. Donate cryptocurrency
Donating cryptocurrency is a great way to make a positive impact and claim tax benefits. [**Donating cryptocurrency is not subject to capital gains tax**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/crypto-donations-taxes>), and you claim a tax deduction based on the value of your donation!
## When do you need to report your crypto taxes?
For the 2024 tax year, the deadline for American taxpayers is April 15, 2025. The deadline for American expatriates is June 15, 2024. The extension deadline is October 15, 2025. You will need to fill an extension request before April 15 to be eligible for this deadline.
## What if you forgot to report your crypto taxes?
If youʼre like many other crypto investors, thereʼs a strong chance that you werenʼt always aware of the fact that your crypto-related income needed to be reported on your taxes.
If you are in this situation, donʼt worry. You can amend a prior year's tax return to include your crypto-related income with [**IRS Form 1040X**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040x>).
Itʼs always better to amend your return in good faith rather than waiting for the IRS to find you. While there is never a way to guarantee that someone won’t be audited after amending their taxes, paying your taxes before the IRS begins an investigation can go a long way to demonstrate that further inquiry is unlikely to find additional reporting errors.
For a detailed guide, check out our blog post on [**how to amend your tax return to include your crypto**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/what-to-do-if-you-forgot-to-report-your-crypto-trades-on-last-years-tax-return>).
## How to calculate your cryptocurrency capital gains and losses
To calculate your capital gains and losses from each of your crypto sells, trades, or disposals, simply apply the formula:
![Formula for capital gain calculation](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/673dfb6ef7c16c285f8694b9_673dfa4e659a247c8b02c490_Explainer-Infographic-Remake-v2-infogrpahic-3.jpeg)
### What is proceeds?
Proceeds represents how much value you received in exchange for disposing of your crypto-asset. Typically, this will be the fair market value of your assets at the time of disposal minus the cost of relevant fees.
### What is cost basis?
[**Cost basis**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/crypto-cost-basis>) represents how much money you put into purchasing your property (i.e. how much it cost you). Cost basis includes purchase price plus all other costs associated with purchasing your cryptocurrency (fees, etc).
### Example:
Charlie buys ETH for $250.
Later, he sells ETH for $400.
Charlie has a capital gain of $150.
In the example above, Charlie’s cost basis is $250, while his proceeds are $400.
**Applying the formula:**
$400 (Proceeds) - $250 (Cost Basis) = $150 Gain
## How to use cost basis methods 
In some situations, investors buy the same cryptocurrency at multiple price points. 
### Example:
January 1: Henry buys 1 BTC for $15,000
February 3: Henry buys 1 BTC for $50,000.
March 3: Henry buys 1 BTC for $40,000.
April 1: Henry sells 1 BTC for 15,000.
What is Henry’s capital gain?
If you find yourself in this situation, you’ll need to use a cost basis method like [**FIFO, LIFO, or HIFO**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-calculations-fifo-and-lifo-costing-methods-explained>). These cost basis methods determine the ‘order’ in which your cryptocurrency gets disposed of. 
Let’s walk through how these cost basis methods work. 
**FIFO:** FIFO is first-in first-out. The first cryptocurrency you acquired is the first you dispose of when calculating your gain or loss. 
**LIFO:** LIFO is last-in first-out. With this method, the last cryptocurrency you acquired is the first you dispose of. LIFO can help you save money on taxes in a period of rising prices. 
**HIFO:** HIFO is highest-in first-out. With this method, the highest price cryptocurrency you acquire is the first you dispose of. 
FIFO is considered the default method for most investors. If you choose a ‘specific identification’ method like LIFO or HIFO, you’ll need to specifically identify each individual unit of cryptocurrency.
In our example above, depending on which method he uses, Henry's gain/loss would be the following:
  * FIFO: $0 (15,000 - 15,000)
  * LIFO: -$25,000 (15,000 - 40,000)
  * HIFO: -$35,000 (15,000 - 50,000)


## Do cryptocurrency exchanges send tax forms?
![Crypto exchanges send inacurrate tax forms](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/673dfb6ef7c16c285f8694bc_673dfa58bb1b2207be590ad2_Explainer-Infographic-Remake-v2-infogrpahic-4.jpeg)
Cryptocurrency exchanges often send 1099 forms to users detailing capital gains and losses to users. This may include [**Form 1099-B**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/form-1099-b>), [**Form 1099-MISC**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/form-1099-misc>), and [**Form 1099-K**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/what-to-do-with-your-1099-k-from-coinbase-gemini-or-gdax-for-crypto-taxes>). Starting in 2025, exchanges will be required to issue [**Form 1099-DA**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/form-1099-da>).
### What is Form 1099-B?
Form 1099-B is a form specifically designed to report capital gains and losses from investment assets. Remember, your Form 1099-B may not be accurate if you transferred your cryptocurrency into or out of an exchange. In this case, your exchange may not have a record of your cost basis/proceeds and will not be able to accurately calculate your capital gains.
### What is Form 1099-MISC?
Form 1099-MISC is a form designed to report ‘miscellaneous’ income — such as income from staking and airdrops. Most exchanges will send you this form if you’ve earned more than $600 in miscellaneous income during the tax year. 
### What is Form 1099-K?
Form 1099-K is a tax form designed for payment processors that was issued by cryptocurrency exchanges in the past. Form 1099-K shows the total transaction volume for transactions — which can make it appear as though the user has a significant unpaid tax liability (even when they have accurately reported their taxes). Many exchanges sent Form 1099-K in the past, but most have stopped sending this tax form due to the confusion they caused for both customers and tax authorities.
### What is Form 1099-DA?
Form 1099-DA is a form designed specifically to report your gains and losses from digital assets. Of course, Form 1099-DA will still be limited when it comes to tracking wallet-to-wallet transfers. As a result, you’ll still be required to keep track of your capital gains and losses on your own.
## Why reporting your crypto taxes can be difficult
As you can see from the examples above, calculating your capital gains and losses from your crypto trading activity requires keeping track of your cost basis, fair market value, and USD gain or loss every time you dispose of a crypto (trade, sell, spend, etc).
![What you need to report crypto taxes ](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/655361c094fb155303ad99ff_62d02360fdd89d2f66eef121_usa-guide15.png)
Without this information, you cannot accurately calculate your realized income or capital gains from your trading activity, and you won’t be able to accurately report them on your tax return.
Gathering and maintaining this information is extremely challenging for many cryptocurrency investors as most havenʼt been keeping detailed records of their investing activity. Tracking the cost basis and USD prices for every cryptocurrency across all exchanges, wallets, and protocols at any given time quickly turns into a difficult, if not impossible, spreadsheet exercise.
This is the reason why hundreds of thousands of crypto investors are turning to [**crypto tax software**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/>) like CoinLedger to automate their crypto tax reporting. You can sign up for a [**free account here**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/app.coinledger.io/?referrer=coinledger>).
## How do you report crypto on your taxes?
You’re required to report your capital gains income and ordinary income on your taxes. We dive into the reporting for each of these income types below.
### How to report crypto capital gains
Your capital gains and losses from your crypto trades get reported on [**IRS Form 8949**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/form-8949-for-cryptocurrency>).
Form 8949 is the tax form that is used to report the sales and disposals of capital assets, including cryptocurrency. Other capital assets include stocks and bonds.
To fill out Form 8949, list all of your cryptocurrency trades, sells, and disposals into the relevant column (pictured below) along with the date you acquired the crypto, the date your crypto was sold or traded, your gross proceeds, your cost basis, and your gain or loss for the trade.
![Form 8949 tax example ](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/655361c09737d9b644bfc221_62d02404a451686fd8ba3b97_usa-guide16.png)
Once you have each trade listed, total them up and fill in your net capital gain or loss for the year at the bottom.
For a detailed walkthrough of Form 8949, check out this blog post: [**How To Report Cryptocurrency to the IRS**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/how-to-report-cryptocurrency-on-taxes>).
### How to report crypto income tax
Typically, you can report crypto income on Schedule 1. However, you may report your cryptocurrency income on Schedule C if you are operating a business. 
**Schedule 1** - If you earned crypto from staking, airdrops, forks, or other crypto hobby income, it’s generally reported on [**Schedule 1**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s1.pdf>)as _other income_. (Not subject to self-employment tax.) Most investors will use this form to report crypto income. 
**Schedule C** - If you earned crypto while operating a business, like receiving payments for contract work, running a cryptocurrency mining operation, or operating a node, this is often treated as self-employment income and is reported on [**Schedule C**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-schedule-c-form-1040>). Schedule C also allows you to deduct business expenses such as electricity used for mining.
To make things easier for investors, CoinLedger generates a complete [**income report**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/crypto-tax-form>) that is included with your completed crypto tax reports. This report details the US Dollar value of all of your cryptocurrency income events that you received throughout the year: mining, staking, airdrops, and more. This income report can be used to complete your relevant ordinary income tax forms like Schedule 1 and Schedule C.

## How is buying cryptocurrency taxed?
Buying cryptocurrency with fiat currency is **tax-free.**
![Buying crypto with fiat is tax free](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/673dfb6ef7c16c285f8694bf_673dfb0dee0cd29d03f6ecf5_Explainer-Infographic-Remake-v2-infogrpahic-8.jpeg)

TAX FREE
## Do I pay tax for holding cryptocurrency?
There’s no tax for simply holding cryptocurrency. 
TAX FREE
## How is transferring crypto between different wallets taxed?
[**Transferring crypto between wallets**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/is-transferring-crypto-between-wallets-taxable>) that you own is tax-free. However, you may pay taxes on fees paid to transfer your crypto (this is considered a taxable disposal).
You should keep a detailed record of your cryptocurrency transfers so that you can calculate your capital gains and losses in a disposal event.
CAPITAL GAINS TAX
## How is selling cryptocurrency taxed?
Selling cryptocurrency is a disposal event subject to capital gains tax. You’ll incur a capital gain or loss depending on how the price of your crypto changed since you originally received it.
### Example:
Jordan buys BTC for $1,000.
Later, he sells BTC for $1,500.
Jordan incurs $500 of capital gain ($1,500 - $1,000).
CAPITAL GAINS TAX
## Do you pay taxes when spending crypto?
When you spend cryptocurrency to purchase goods and services, you’ll incur a capital gain or loss depending on how the price of your crypto has changed since you originally received it.
CAPITAL GAINS TAX
## How are crypto-to-crypto trades taxed?
Trading your crypto for another cryptocurrency is considered a disposal event subject to capital gains tax. You’ll incur a capital gain or loss depending on how the price of the crypto you traded away has changed since you originally received it.
### Example:
Jamie buys $1,000 of BTC.
The price of Jamie’s BTC rises to $1,200.
Jamie trades his BTC for ETH.
Jamie incurs $200 of capital gain ($1,200-$1,000).
TAX DEDUCTIBLE
## How are crypto losses taxed?
Cryptocurrency losses can be used to offset 100% of your gains from cryptocurrency, stocks, and other assets and up to $3,000 of income for the year. Any additional losses can be rolled forward into future tax years.
### Example:
Rachel buys $2,000 of SOL.
The price of Rachel’s SOL drops to $1,500.
Rachel sells her SOL.
Rachel has a capital loss of $500, which she can use to offset income!
TAX DEDUCTIBLE
## How are crypto fees taxed?
[**Exchange fees**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/how-exchange-fees-can-reduce-your-tax-bill>) and [**blockchain gas fees**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/ethereum-gas-fees>) related to acquiring and disposing of your crypto can reduce your capital gains.
Fees related to acquiring your crypto can be added to your cost basis.
Meanwhile, fees related to disposing of your crypto can be subtracted from your gross proceeds.
### Example:
Scott buys $300 of BTC and pays $10 of fees.
Scott’s cost basis in BTC is $310.
Later, Scott sells his BTC for $400.
Scott’s incurs a capital gain of $90 ($400 - $310).
Income Tax
Capital Gains Tax
## How is mining cryptocurrency taxed?
![Crypto mining taxes ](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/65536e84ee1c4f41f126fc47_636e5ae449cf121eeb3408ca_Crypto%2520Tax%2520Guide%2520Rebrand_Batch%25202_1623.webp)
Cryptocurrency mining rewards are considered income based on the fair market value of your crypto at the time of receipt. When you dispose of your rewards, you’ll pay capital gains tax based on how the price of your crypto has changed since you originally received it.
**Mining crypto as a business:** If you’re mining cryptocurrency as a business, you can deduct relevant expenses such as the depreciation of your equipment and electricity.
**Mining crypto as a hobby:** If you’re mining cryptocurrency as a hobby, you are not allowed to deduct relevant expenses.
You can read more in our complete guide on [**how crypto mining is taxed**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/how-to-handle-cryptocurrency-mining-on-your-taxes>).

Capital Gains Tax
## How is staking cryptocurrency taxed?
[**Cryptocurrency staking rewards**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/staking-taxes>) are considered income based on the fair market value of your crypto at the time of receipt.
When you dispose of your rewards, you’ll pay capital gains tax based on how the price of your crypto has changed since you originally received it.
### Example:
Sara earns $200 of ETH from staking.
The price of her ETH rises to $250.
Sara sells her ETH.
Sara recognizes $200 of income and $50 of capital gain.
Income Tax
Capital Gains Tax
## How are airdrops taxed?
Cryptocurrency received from an airdrop is taxed as income. This means that you are liable for income taxes on the USD value of the claimed airdrop.
When you dispose of airdrop rewards, you’ll incur a capital gain or loss depending on how the price of your crypto has changed since you originally received it.
For more information, check out our [**guide to airdrop taxes.**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/airdrop-taxes>)
Income Tax
Capital Gains Tax
## How are hard forks taxed?
In a cryptocurrency hard fork, a blockchain splits into two and an entirely new cryptocurrency is created. If you receive units of this new cryptocurrency, you’ll recognize income based on the fair market value of your coins at the time of receipt.
### Example:
Megan receives 2.5 Bitcoin Cash in a hard fork.
The fair market value of Megan’s Bitcoin Cash is $1,250.
Megan reports $1,250 of personal income.
If you dispose of your forked cryptocurrency in the future, you’ll incur a capital gain or loss depending on how its price has changed since you originally received it.
TAX FREE
### How are cryptocurrency soft forks taxed?
Sometimes, a cryptocurrency will need to rebrand or change its architecture for increased functionality. When this happens, the conversion from the old version of the token to the new version of the token is **not** a taxable event. Similar to a stock split or a company changing tickers on the stock market, the underlying cost basis will carry through into the new asset without triggering a taxable event.
A good rule of thumb is that if you haven’t received any new cryptocurrency as a result of a fork, there is no taxable event.
Income Tax
Capital Gains Tax
## How is crypto interest taxed?
Currently, platforms like [**Gemini**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/integrations/gemini>) offer users interest rewards for holding select cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency interest is considered personal income and is taxed accordingly.
When you dispose of cryptocurrency interest rewards, you’ll recognize a capital gain or loss depending on how the price of your crypto changed since you originally received it. 
Tax free
Capital Gains Tax
## How are cryptocurrency loans taxed?
Today, investors can receive loans using cryptocurrency as collateral from centralized exchanges and decentralized protocols. 
Generally, receiving a loan is **not** considered a taxable event.
However, some DeFi loan protocols use crypto-to-crypto swaps to facilitate loans. It’s possible that these swaps will be considered disposals subject to capital gains tax.
For more information, check [**out our guide to how cryptocurrency loans are taxed.**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/crypto-loans-taxes>)
CAPITAL GAINS TAX
## How is margin and futures trading taxed?
Cryptocurrency exchanges like BitMex and Binance.com have popularized the use of margin and futures trading. The IRS has not yet set forth explicit guidance on how these cryptocurrency transactions should be handled from a tax perspective, but it’s likely that any profits or losses from margin trading will be treated as capital gains and losses.
For more information, check out our [**guide to cryptocurrency margin trading taxes.**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/crypto-margin-trades-taxes>)

## How are crypto gifts taxed?
![Crypto gifts are tax-free](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/673dfb70f7c16c285f869515_673dfb3410c7ad7d5ee1e7ee_Explainer-Infographic-Remake-v2-infogrpahic-7.jpeg)
If you are feeling generous, you can send a cryptocurrency gift to a friend or family member without having to worry about paying additional taxes.
Generally, cryptocurrency gifts are tax-free for all but the most generous gift-givers. Gift taxes are not imposed until the gift-giver has gifted away over $13.61 million dollars in their lifetime. Even then, the gift recipient will never have to pay taxes for merely receiving the gift.
However, if you send a gift or gifts with a fair market value above $18,000 to any individual in a year, you will need to file a gift tax return in addition to your traditional tax returns. This form is for informational purposes and does not mean you will be required to pay taxes on your gift.
For more information, check out our guide to [**crypto gift taxes.**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/cryptocurrency-gift-tax>)

## How are crypto donations taxed?
![The tax benefits of crypto donations](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/673dfb70f7c16c285f869518_673dfa65f6ebd0379c199f03_Explainer-Infographic-Remake-v2-infogrpahic-5.jpeg)
Crypto donations to registered charities come with multiple tax benefits! 
  * Crypto donations are not considered a taxable disposal.
  * You can deduct the value of your donation on your tax return!


If you are claiming a deduction larger than $500, you will need to report this on [**Form 8283.**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8283.pdf>)
The amount of your donation that is tax-deductible depends on how long you have held the assets:
  * for crypto held for less than a year, you can deduct whichever is lower: the cryptocurrencyʼs fair market value at the time of your donation or your cost basis
  * for crypto held for less than a year, you can deduct whichever is lower: the cryptocurrencyʼs fair market value at the time of your donation or your cost basis for that cryptocurrency

## How is lost and stolen cryptocurrency taxed?
Lost, stolen, and hacked cryptocurrency is no longer tax-deductible after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This includes:
  * Coins lost due to exchange hacks
  * Coins lost due to wallets being hacked
  * Coins lost from sending crypto to an incorrect address
  * Other negligent forms of crypto losses

## How are exchange bankruptcies taxed?
In 2022, exchanges like Voyager and Celsius went bankrupt, causing millions of investors to lose access to their cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrency that is lost after an exchange bankruptcy likely can be treated as an investment loss. However, it’s important to note that claiming these losses means that you relinquish your right to reclaim your assets once the bankruptcy process is over.

## How do DeFi taxes work?
Cryptocurrency lending platforms and other DeFi services like Uniswap, Maker, and Compound have exploded in popularity in recent years.
It’s important to remember that the same tax rules that apply to other cryptocurrency transactions apply to DeFi. That means:
  1. Profits from cryptocurrency disposals — such as crypto-to-crypto trades — are taxed as capital gains
  2. Earned cryptocurrency — such as DeFi staking rewards — are taxed as income


It’s important to remember that the DeFi space is constantly innovating. As a result, there are often novel investment arrangements that do not fit squarely into existing tax frameworks.
The full tax implications associated with transactions common to the DeFi landscape are outside of the scope of this piece; however, we discuss them thoroughly in our [**DeFi Crypto Tax Guide.**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/defi-crypto-tax-guide>)

## How is adding and removing liquidity taxed?
When you deposit your cryptocurrency in a decentralized liquidity pool, you’ll typically receive LP tokens that represent your position.
At this time, the IRS has not given explicit guidance on how depositing and withdrawing liquidity is taxed. You can take a **conservative or aggressive approach** depending on your risk appetite.
_Conservative approach_ : Treat withdrawing and depositing liquidity as crypto-to-crypto trades subject to capital gains tax. You’ll incur a capital gain or loss depending on how the price of your crypto has changed since you originally received it.
_Aggressive approach_ : Treat withdrawing and depositing liquidity as non-taxable.
In general, it’s recommended that you take the conservative approach. However, how to report your taxes may vary depending on the specific mechanisms of your DeFi protocol. You should reach out to a [**crypto tax professional**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/crypto-tax-accountants>) if you’re unsure how to report your liquidity pool transactions.

## How do NFT taxes work?
From a tax perspective, [NFTs](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/learn/how-to-trade-nfts>) are treated similarly to cryptocurrencies and are taxed upon disposal.
**Buying an NFT with cryptocurrency** : Making a purchase with cryptocurrency is considered a disposal. You’ll incur a capital gain or loss depending on how the price of your crypto has changed since you originally received it.
**Selling/trading away an NFT:** When you dispose of an NFT, you’ll incur a capital gain or loss depending on how its price has changed since you originally received it.
![NFT capital loss example ](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/65536e84d0285f90261950d5_636e5ae0ef41c90956031c16_Crypto%2520Tax%2520Guide%2520Infographic%25204%2520V2_0312323.webp)
**Minting NFTs:** If you’re a creator, you’ll recognize income based on the revenue you receive from primary and secondary NFT sales.
The IRS has said that NFTs may be subject to the 28% collectible tax in certain circumstances. It’s possible that ‘profile picture’ and ‘art’ NFTs will be considered collectibles and taxed accordingly. 
For more information, check out our [**Complete NFT Tax Guide.**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/how-are-nfts-taxed>)
INCOME TAX
## How are DAOs taxed?
So far, the IRS hasn’t provided any guidance on how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are taxed. It’s likely that they’ll be considered ‘flow-through entities’. This means that while the DAO itself won’t pay taxes, individuals in the DAO recognize income based on their share of the organization’s profits.
For more information, check out our [**guide to DAO taxes.**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/dao-taxes>)
## How do other countries handle crypto taxes?

## Why crypto exchanges can't provide accurate tax forms
[**Cryptocurrency exchanges**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/tools/best-crypto-exchanges>) like [**Coinbase**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/integrations/coinbase>), [**Binance**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/integrations/binance>), and others often do not have the ability to provide their users with accurate capital gains and losses tax reports. This is not a fault of the exchanges themselves, it is simply a product of the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies—namely their transferability.
Because users are constantly transferring crypto into and out of exchanges, the exchange has no way of knowing how, when, where, or at what _cost basis_ you originally acquired your cryptocurrencies. The exchange only sees when crypto appears in your wallet and what the USD value was at the time of the deposit.
The second you transfer crypto into or out of an exchange, that exchange loses the ability to give you an accurate report detailing the _cost basis_ of your cryptocurrencies, one of the mandatory components for tax reporting.
### Example: Why is it difficult to report crypto taxes?
Billy buys crypto for $10,000 on Exchange A.
He transfers his crypto to a cold wallet.
Billy sells his crypto for $15,000 on Exchange B.
Exchange B doesn’t know Billy’s original cost basis and can’t provide him with accurate tax records.
As pictured below, Coinbase explained to users how their generated tax reports wonʼt be accurate if any of them transferred crypto into/out of Coinbase. This affects over two-thirds of Coinbase users, which amounts to millions of people who cannot rely on Coinbase’s calculations to prepare their tax forms.
You can read more about the “crypto tax problem” in our blog post: [**Why Exchanges Canʼt Report Crypto Taxes**](https://coinledger.io/guides/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-problem>).

## How to track cryptocurrency for tax purposes
You can aggregate all of your transaction history by hand by pulling together your transactions from each of your exchanges and wallets. Of course, this can take a lot of time and energy. 
The easiest way to report your crypto taxes is to use [‍**crypto tax software**](https://coinledger.io/guides/</>). A platform like CoinLedger can automatically import your transactions from all of your wallets and exchanges. Once this is done, you’ll be able to generate an accurate tax report containing all of your transaction data.
![Automatically import transactions from your exchange ](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/6553701431f3325e52ca36ab_62d16e2641b1e18286467dc4_usa-guide24.png)
## How cryptocurrency tax software can help
Cryptocurrency tax software like CoinLedger is built to automate the entire crypto tax reporting process.
By integrating directly with leading exchanges, wallets, blockchains, and DeFi protocols, the CoinLedger engine can auto-generate all of your necessary tax reports. You can test out how it works by creating an account for free.
### How it works
1. Select each of the cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and platforms youʼve used throughout the years.
![Connect your exchanges and wallets to CoinLedger ](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/655370678b8d03169c81eb67_62d1797874fe2f3e58e0834b_usa-guide25.png)
2. Import your historical transactions by connecting your accounts to the CoinLedger platform or uploading the CSV transaction history report from your exchange. Note, CoinLedger requires “read only” access to your exchange account. This type of access protects your funds and does not give CoinLedger any ability to move funds or transact on your behalf.
![CoinLedger crypto transactions import ](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/655370679312e40855dc089c_62d17994cacbaf638c013b7b_usa-guide26.png)
3. Finally, generate your complete crypto tax reports with the click of a button.
