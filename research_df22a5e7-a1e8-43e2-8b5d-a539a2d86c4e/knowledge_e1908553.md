Yes, many individuals and institutions have made substantial returns on their cryptocurrency investments. Success in cryptocurrency investing often comes from a combination of strategic planning, timing, and understanding the market. Here are some strategies and factors that have contributed to successful returns in cryptocurrency investments:

Yes, many individuals and institutions have made substantial returns on their cryptocurrency investments. Success in cryptocurrency investing often comes from a combination of strategic planning, timing, and understanding the market. Here are some strategies and factors that have contributed to successful returns in cryptocurrency investments:
1. Early Adoption
  * Timing: Some investors achieved significant returns by entering the cryptocurrency market early, particularly during the early days of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.
  * Examples: Early adopters who invested in Bitcoin when it was valued at just a few dollars or in Ethereum during its initial coin offering (ICO) have seen substantial returns as these cryptocurrencies increased in value.


2. Long-Term Holding (HODLing)
  * Strategy: The "HODL" strategy involves buying and holding cryptocurrencies for an extended period, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. This approach relies on the belief that the asset will appreciate over time.
  * Examples: Investors who held onto Bitcoin or Ethereum through market volatility and significant price dips have often seen substantial gains in the long run.


3. Diversification
  * Portfolio Diversification: Successful investors often diversify their cryptocurrency holdings to spread risk and capitalize on potential growth across different assets.
  * Examples: Investing in a mix of established cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) and promising altcoins can provide a balanced approach to potential returns.


4. Research and Analysis
  * Fundamental Analysis: Investors who thoroughly research and analyze the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies—including technology, team, use case, and market potential—often make more informed investment decisions.
  * Technical Analysis: Utilizing technical analysis to identify entry and exit points based on historical price data and market trends can help optimize returns.


5. Active Trading and Arbitrage
  * Active Trading: Some investors achieve high returns by actively trading cryptocurrencies, taking advantage of short-term price movements and market inefficiencies.
  * Arbitrage: Exploiting price differences between different exchanges or markets to make profits through arbitrage can be a successful strategy for experienced traders.


6. Staking and Yield Farming
  * Staking: Investing in cryptocurrencies that offer staking rewards allows investors to earn additional tokens by participating in network validation and security.
  * Yield Farming: Providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms in exchange for interest or rewards can generate additional returns on invested assets.


7. Participating in ICOs and Token Sales
  * Early Investment: Investing in promising ICOs or token sales at an early stage can offer significant returns if the project becomes successful and the token appreciates in value.
  * Examples: Early investors in successful ICOs like Ethereum and Chainlink have seen substantial returns as these projects gained traction.


8. Risk Management
  * Setting Stop-Loss Orders: Implementing stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and protect gains can help manage risk and preserve capital.
  * Diversifying Risk: Avoiding putting all funds into a single cryptocurrency and spreading investments across multiple assets helps mitigate the impact of poor performance in any one asset.


9. Utilizing Reputable Platforms
  * Choosing Reliable Exchanges: Using well-regulated and reputable cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets helps ensure security and reduce the risk of losses due to fraud or technical issues.


10. Staying Informed and Adapting
  * Market Trends: Staying informed about market trends, news, and technological developments helps investors make timely decisions and adapt to changing conditions.
  * Community Engagement: Engaging with cryptocurrency communities and following expert opinions can provide valuable insights and investment opportunities.


Conclusion: Successful cryptocurrency investors often use a combination of early adoption, long-term holding, diversification, thorough research, active trading, staking, participating in ICOs, risk management, and staying informed. While these strategies have proven effective for some, it’s important to remember that cryptocurrency investments carry high risks, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Careful planning, risk management, and continuous learning are key to navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Yes, there are numerous successful case studies of people making significant money from crypto investments. Notable examples include early investors in Bitcoin and Ethereum, who saw substantial returns as the value of these cryptocurrencies skyrocketed. Public figures like the Winklevoss twins and various early adopters have also reported significant gains. However, it’s important to remember that while some have profited, others have experienced substantial losses, highlighting the volatility and risk inherent in crypto investments.

Building a website can be fast, cheap, and easy if you know the best way to do it.
You might have heard stories of professionals doing it and think that creating a website is expensive and complicated?
It can be in some cases, but don't worry - there are ways that even a complete newcomer can create a marvelous site.
You only need to follow a few essential steps I'll talk about below.
In no time, you'll have a bright and shiny webpage made all by yourself.
Start with choosing a hosting plan and buying a domain.
Before building a website, you will need to choose a hosting provider and buy a plan.
When you purchase a hosting plan, a hosting company provides space in its data center for your website placement.
You will find a tremendous amount of different hosting companies, although if you want to choose the one that fits your needs the best.
You should take a look at a few criteria, such as choosing the [right hosting plan](https://www.quora.com/<https:/www.hostinger.com/tutorials/shared-hosting-vs-vps-hosting/?utm_source=quora.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=answers&utm_content=20191209_build-a-website-from-scratch> "www.hostinger.com"), reasonable uptime, 24/7 customer support, good speed, and enough disc space.
Along with a hosting plan, you'll need a purchase of a domain. The domain is the virtual address of your website, so it's crucial to choose a domain that represents your website the best.
To come up with the name, think of the best site names you know and admire for inspiration. You can also use a little help from [this tutorial](https://www.quora.com/<https:/www.hostinger.com/tutorials/blog-name-generators?utm_source=quora.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=answers&utm_content=20191209_build-a-website-from-scratch> "www.hostinger.com") on generating names.
Have in mind that there are around 354 million domain names already taken, so don't rush to cross out other less popular options.
Another thing, with specific hosting plans, you might get [a free domain](https://www.quora.com/<https:/www.hostinger.com/free-domain?utm_source=quora.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=answers&utm_content=20191209_build-a-website-from-scratch> "www.hostinger.com"). A win-win!
![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c11005db74e9ccce783ddac05926964a-lq)
Now that you already have hosting and domain figured out, you can start making the website. There are a few main ways to build a website:
  * Website Builder


The site builder option is the easiest as it works with a primary drag and drop function and is highly customizable. Most likely, your hosting company will provide the website builder as a complementary product, and it will be super easy to figure it out.
  * Content Management System (CMS)


A second and most popular option is building a website with a Content Management System. There are plenty of different CMSs like Joomla and Drupal, but none of them beat WordPress. Around 34% of the internet is powered by WordPress, and its definitely the most popular CMS out there. Building a website on WP is moderately difficult for someone without any experience, although it doesn't take too much time to master it. Here is a very nice and simple [video tutorial](https://www.quora.com/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXBohfjc4WA&utm_source=quora.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=answers&utm_content=20191209_build-a-website-from-scratch> "www.youtube.com") which explains step by step approach on creating a website with WP.
  * E-commerce platform


For an online shop website, you will need to use open-source e-commerce scripts. This includes platforms like PrestaShop, Magento, and WooCommerce. These platforms will help out a lot while managing an online store because they are specifically designed for that reason. The difficulty level of these programs is similar to the CMS, and it doesn't take too long to learn the ropes.
  * Making it from scratch


Another way of building your website is from scratch. This type of website building is mostly done by professional developers and usually used by major companies. For a person without any programming experience, it would be too complicated to create a professional-looking website. It takes a lot of time and skill to master using the programs alone. In case you are wondering for the most basic site, you'll need to know HTML, CSS and PHP, text editors, and some automated tools. Not only that, but you will also need to learn back-end programming languages like JavaScript or Python and write code. If you are curious, here is a [good explanation](https://www.quora.com/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/how-to-create-a-website-from-scratch/?utm_source=quora.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=answers&utm_content=20191209_build-a-website-from-scratch> "www.bitdegree.org") of all the steps you'll need to take.
![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1bab2723a0e7347dbb326f92d8d22543-pjlq)
Creating your website from scratch might sound very exciting, and many think that for a company, it's important to build their website that way.
Although, for small and medium-sized companies, it's best to use CMS, in order to save time, money, and additional resources.
Creating a website from scratch by a professional can [cost thousands](https://www.quora.com/<https:/www.hostinger.com/tutorials/website-cost?utm_source=quora.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=answers&utm_content=20191209_build-a-website-from-scratch> "www.hostinger.com") and take months, so you need to evaluate your company's needs.
So you've built the frame, now you need to improve it
After all the technical parts comes the time to set it all up. As all the major things are done, it's time to polish the site to make it shine.
During this part, you can start filling it with pictures, written content, products, set up the security measures, and optimize it for the best performance.
  * Fill in the website with written content. Make sure to write in understandable, clear, and short sentences, learn who is your audience, and write to them. If you are creating a store or a professional site, avoid using slang and jargon. While writing make text scannable - people don't like reading long and monotonic looking texts.
  * Improve your site speed by optimizing it. Many think that website speed depends solely on the hosting company, although there is a lot you can change by merely optimizing it. Not only it will help you with a higher SEO rank, but also your visitors will feel much happier visiting a fast loading page and convert more. You can start by checking your website's speed on [GTmetrix](https://www.quora.com/<https:/www.hostinger.com/tutorials/gtmetrix-for-testing-websites-speed?utm_source=quora.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=answers&utm_content=20191209_build-a-website-from-scratch> "www.hostinger.com").
  * Implement security - you don't want any trouble concerning your websites and your visitors' safety. To prevent that, there are some steps you can take, like implementing captcha, limiting login attempts, installing the security plugins, implementing CloudFare, and keeping things up to date. Also, don't forget to get an SSL/TLS certificate - it will make your visitors feel secure.
  * Link your site with [Google analytics](https://www.quora.com/<https:/analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/?utm_source=quora.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=answers&utm_content=20191209_build-a-website-from-scratch#%2Fprovision> "analytics.google.com")- it will be much easier understanding your audience, getting data, and making decisions when GA gives you constant insights regarding traffic, target audience, and more.
  * Last but not least, make a strategic digital marketing plan and make your website visible out there. You have unlocked the power of the internet; now you need to use it to the full potential.


So here you have it, a comprehensive guide on building a website.
Good luck making your vision into reality, and don't forget that even if it's challenging at first, it can be an enjoyable and entertaining process after you know the in's and out's of website building!

Bitcoin has not only been a trendsetter, ushering in a wave of cryptocurrencies built on a decentralized peer network—it has also become the de facto standard for cryptocurrencies, inspiring an ever-growing legion of followers and spinoffs. 
Because it isn't the only cryptocurrency available, looking into others and finding out which ones besides [Bitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp>) are doing well is essential. Here are some alternative cryptocurrencies that have held on throughout the steep price climbs and nosedives. 
### Key Takeaways
  * Bitcoin continues to lead the pack of cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, user base, and popularity.
  * Other virtual currencies, such as Ethereum, are helping to create decentralized financial (DeFi) systems.
  * Some altcoins have been endorsed as having newer features than Bitcoin, such as the ability to handle more transactions per second or use different consensus algorithms.


##  What Are Cryptocurrencies? 
Before taking a closer look at some of these alternatives to Bitcoin (BTC), let's step back and briefly examine what we mean by "[cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp>)" and "[altcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altcoin.asp>)": 
  * A cryptocurrency, broadly defined, is virtual or digital money that takes the form of "tokens" or "coins."
  * The cryptocurrencies modeled after Bitcoin are collectively called altcoins and have sometimes tried to present themselves as modified or improved versions of Bitcoin.


The "crypto" in cryptocurrencies refers to the cryptographic technics (techniques and technology) that allow for creating and processing digital currencies. Alongside this important "crypto" feature is a common commitment to remaining decentralized; cryptocurrencies are typically developed by teams who build in mechanisms for issuance and other controls. 
Cryptocurrencies are almost always designed to be free from government manipulation and control—although, as they have grown more popular, this foundational aspect of the industry has dwindled somewhat through regulatory developments. 
##  Types of Altcoins 
###  Cryptocurrencies 
Cryptocurrencies are intended for payments, transmitting value (akin to digital money) across a decentralized network of users. Many altcoins (i.e., those that are not Bitcoin or sometimes Ethereum) are classified in this way. 
###  Tokens 
There are also blockchain-based tokens that are meant to serve a different purpose from that of money. One example could be a token issued as part of an initial coin offering (ICO) that represents a stake in a blockchain or decentralized finance (DeFi) project. If the tokens are linked to the value of the company or project, they can be called security tokens (as in securities like stocks, not safety). 
Other tokens have a particular use case or function. Examples include [Storj tokens](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/storj-cryptocurrency-definition-5224160>), which allow people to share files across a decentralized network, or Namecoin, which provides a decentralized Domain Name System (DNS) service for internet addresses. These are known as utility tokens.12
Today, while many crypto users understand and appreciate these differences, traders and lay investors may not notice the difference because all categories of tokens tend to trade on crypto exchanges in the same way. 
##  1. Ethereum (ETH) 
The first Bitcoin alternative on our list, Ethereum (ETH), is a decentralized software platform that enables smart contracts and [decentralized applications (dApps)](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp>) to be built and run without downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party. The goal behind Ethereum is to create a decentralized suite of financial products that anyone in the world can freely access, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or faith.3
This aspect makes the implications for people in some countries more compelling because those without state infrastructure and state identifications can get access to bank accounts, loans, insurance, or a variety of other financial products. 
Ethereum uses ether, its platform-specific cryptographic token. Ether (ETH) is used to pay validators who stake their coins for their work for the blockchain, as an off-chain payment method, and as an investment by speculators. 
On Sep. 15, 2022, Ethereum completed its long-anticipated transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) validation method. PoS is less energy-intensive because it removes incentivized mining, makes the blockchain more efficient, and allows it to scale better.4
Ether (ETH) has maintained a second-place standing by market capitalization following Bitcoin for years, although it lags behind the dominant cryptocurrency by a significant margin. Trading at around $2,736 on Feb. 7, 2025, Ether's market cap of almost $329.5 billion was less than Bitcoin's $1.93 trillion.5
##  2. Tether (USDT) 
Tether (USDT) was one of the first and most popular of the stablecoins—alternative cryptocurrencies that aim to peg their market value to a currency or other external reference point to reduce volatility. Because most digital currencies, even major ones like Bitcoin, have experienced frequent periods of dramatic volatility, Tether and other stablecoins attempt to smooth out price fluctuations to attract users who may otherwise be cautious. 
Tether’s price is tied directly to the U.S. dollar because the developers claim to hold one U.S. dollar (or an equivalent) for every circulating USDT. This system allows users to more easily make transfers from other cryptocurrencies back to U.S. dollars in a more timely manner than actually converting to standard currency.6
Launched in 2014, this cryptocurrency allows individuals to utilize a blockchain network and related technologies to transact in traditional currencies while minimizing [the volatility and complexity](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/clients-ask-about-crypto-5323846>) often associated with digital currencies. 
On Feb. 7, 2025, Tether was the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a market cap of $141.4 billion and a price of $1.5
##  3. Binance Coin (BNB) 
Binance Coin (BNB) is a utility cryptocurrency that operates as a payment method for the fees associated with trading on the Binance Exchange. It is the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization as of Feb. 7, 2025. Those who use the token as a means of payment for the exchange can trade at a discount.7
Binance Coin’s blockchain is also the platform on which Binance’s decentralized exchange operates. The Binance Exchange was founded by Changpeng Zhao and is one of the most widely used exchanges in the world. 
Binance Coin was initially an [ERC-20 token](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/why-crypto-users-need-know-about-erc20-token-standard/>) that operated on the Ethereum blockchain. It eventually launched a mainnet and uses a PoS consensus model. On Feb. 7, 2025, Binance Coin had a $83.4 billion market capitalization, with one BNB valued at around $585.9.5
##  4. Solana (SOL) 
Founded in 2017, Solana is a blockchain platform designed to support decentralized applications (dApps). Also referred to as an 'Ethereum killer,' Solana performs many more transactions per second than Ethereum. Additionally, it charges lower transaction fees than Ethereum.8
Solana and Ethereum can utilize [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp>), which are essential for running cutting-edge applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 
The cryptocurrency running on the Solana blockchain is called Solana (SOL). Since its inception, its price has risen tremendously. Solana had a market capitalization of $96 billion and was valued at around $196.9 on Feb. 7, 2025, making it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.5
##  5. USD Coin (USDC) 
Another stablecoin, USD Coin, also pegs its price to the U.S. dollar using fiat-collateralized reserves, which means it holds an amount of fiat currency equal to the amount of USD Coin in circulation. USD Coin was launched in 2018 by the Centre Consortium, which at one time consisted of Circle and Coinbase, which is no longer part of the project. Because Circle is based in the U.S., it is subject to regulation, making USDC a regulated stablecoin.9
As of Feb. 7, 2025, USD Coin had a market cap of $55.9 billion and a price per coin of $1.00.5
##  6. XRP 
XRP is the [native token](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/what-are-native-tokens-6754173>) for the XRP Ledger, which was created by Ripple in 2012 as a payment system. The XRP Ledger uses a consensus mechanism called the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, which doesn't use proof-of-work or proof-of-stake for consensus and validation.10
Instead, client applications sign and send transactions to the ledger servers. The servers then compare the transactions and conclude whether they are candidates for entry into the ledger.10
The servers then send the transaction candidates to validators, who work to agree that the servers got the transactions right and record the ledger version.11
On Feb. 7, 2025, XRP had a market cap of about $136.1 billion and traded at $2.36.5
##  7. Dogecoin (DOGE) 
[Dogecoin](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dogecoin.asp>) (DOGE), seen by some as the original “memecoin,” caused a stir in 2021 as its price skyrocketed. The coin, which uses an image of the Shiba Inu as its avatar, is accepted as a form of payment by some major companies. 
Dogecoin was created by two software engineers, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, in 2013. Markus and Palmer reportedly created the coin as a joke, commenting on the wild speculation of the cryptocurrency market. 
As of Feb. 7, 2025, Dogecoin’s market capitalization was $37.3 billion, and one DOGE was valued at around $0.252, making it the eighth-largest cryptocurrency.5
### SHIB
A memecoin inspired by a memecoin, [Shiba Inu](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/shiba-inu-shib-5207903>) (SHIB), rose to prominence in the fall of 2021, briefly surpassing Dogecoin's market capitalization.
##  8. Tron (TRX) 
The TRON Foundation launched in 2017 to provide digital content makers full ownership rights through tokenization and dApps.12
The thought behind TRX's launch was to give developers a way to create dApps. In 2018, TRON purchased BitTorrent, a popular file-sharing program, and integrated it into the TRON blockchain. TRON has since transitioned to serving as a decentralized financial application platform.12
TRON's native token, TRX, is used to pay for on-chain transactions and as a payment method on exchanges. Anyone holding TRX can apply to become a Super Representative, someone with the authority and obligation to validate transactions and create new blocks for the blockchain.13
The cryptocurrency's consensus mechanism is a tweaked version of Ethereum's proof-of-stake called designated proof-of-stake (DPoS), where the network votes in the super reps.13
On Feb. 7, 2025, TRX had a value of $0.23 and a market cap of $19.6 billion.5
##  9. Toncoin (TON) 
Toncoin (TON) is the native token for The Open Network, originally developed by the Telegram team. In 2020, the Telegram team abandoned the project after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against it for an unregistered security offering. 
The project was picked up by Telegram CEO Pavel Durov's brother, Dr. Nikoli Durov, and development continued through the TON Foundation. 
On Feb. 7, 2025, TON traded at $3.79 and had a market cap of $9.5 billion.5
##  10. Cardano (ADA) 
[Cardano (ADA)](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/most-important-cryptocurrencies-other-than-bitcoin/<https:/www.investopedia.com/cardano-definition-4683961>) is an "Ouroboros proof-of-stake" cryptocurrency created using a research-based approach by engineers, mathematicians, and cryptography experts. The project was co-founded by Charles Hoskinson, one of the five initial founding members of Ethereum. After disagreeing with the direction that Ethereum was taking, he left and later helped to create Cardano. 
The team behind Cardano created its blockchain through extensive experimentation and peer-reviewed research. The researchers behind the project have written more than 120 papers on blockchain technology across various topics. This research is the backbone of Cardano.14
Due to this rigorous process, Cardano stands out among its PoS peers and other prominent cryptocurrencies. Cardano has also been dubbed an "Ethereum killer" because its blockchain is said to be capable of more. That said, Cardano is still in its early stages, with a long way to go regarding DeFi applications. 
Cardano aims to be the world's financial operating system by establishing DeFi products similar to Ethereum's. It hopes to provide solutions for chain interoperability, voter fraud, and legal contract tracing, among other things. On Feb. 7, 2025, Cardano had the ninth-largest market capitalization at $25.6 billion, and one ADA traded for around $0.73.5
##  Honorable Mentions 
We were only able to list 10 altcoins above, but there are many other important cryptocurrencies out there, and they jockey for position over time in terms of user bases, market value, and influence. Some other important cryptocurrencies include (as of February 2025) but are not limited to:5
More Top Altcoins  
---  
Crypto | Ticker | $ Price | Mkt Cap ($B) | Note  
Polkadot | DOT | $4.68 | $7.2 | A multichain protocol that allows multiple chains to transfer data and tokens

## Which Is the Next Crypto to Boom?
It is difficult to say which crypto will boom next because so many projects are being developed, and market sentiments swing wildly.
## What Crypto Is in High Demand?
Bitcoin is always in high demand because of the returns it has created in the past.
## What Is the Most Important Crypto?
Despite the thousands of competitors that have sprung up, Bitcoin—the original cryptocurrency—remains the dominant player in terms of usage and economic value. None have matched its market cap and value so far.
##  The Bottom Line 
Bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency, but its introduction in 2009 spawned a host of imitators, alternatives, and new technologies based on its blockchain and many of the theories behind it. 
These alternative coins are collectively called altcoins. Their purposes range from being a joke to a coin that pays for transactions on a distributed and global virtual machine. Where they will all end up is anyone's guess, but the years that have passed since they first appeared seems to suggest they aren't going anywhere soon.

Definition
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, most often based on blockchain technology.
##  What Is Cryptocurrency? 
A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. 
A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. 
### Key Takeaways
  * A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.
  * Some experts believe blockchain and related technologies will disrupt many industries, including finance and law.
  * The advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers and decentralized systems that do not collapse at a single point of failure.
  * The disadvantages of cryptocurrencies include their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining activities, and use in criminal activities.

##  Understanding Cryptocurrency 
Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions. 
Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name indicates, a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks of information on an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently verified by each validator on a network. 
Every new block generated must be verified before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by a network of individual nodes, or computers that maintain the ledger.1
Experts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, supply chains, and processes such as online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. ([JPM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=jpm>)) are using blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing.2
##  Types of Cryptocurrency 
Many cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, [Ethereum's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp>) ether was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether (ETH) inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism.3 The XRP Ledger Foundation's XRP is designed for financial institutions to facilitate transfers between different geographies.4
Because there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market, [it's important to understand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/crypto-investment-mistake-6504260>) the types. Knowing whether the coin you're looking at has a purpose can help you decide [whether it is worth investing in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/investing-in-crypto-6502543>)—a cryptocurrency with a purpose is likely to be less risky than one that doesn't have a use. 
Most of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coin's name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types you'll find with some of the names of tokens in that category: 
  * **Utility** : XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains.
  * **Transactional** : Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these.5
  * **Governance** : These tokens represent voting or other rights on a blockchain, such as Uniswap.6
  * **Platform** : These tokens support applications built to use a blockchain, such as Solana.7
  * **Security tokens** : Tokens representing ownership of an asset, such as a stock that has been tokenized (value transferred to the blockchain). MS Token is an example of a securitized token. If you can find one of these for sale, you can gain partial ownership of the Millennium Sapphire.8


If you find a cryptocurrency that doesn't fall into one of these categories, you've found a new category or something that needs to be investigated to be sure it's legitimate. 
##  How to Buy Cryptocurrency 
If you want to use cryptocurrency to buy products and services, you will need to visit a [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/crypto-exchanges-5272125>). These are businesses that allow you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies from other users at the current market price, similar to a stock. After buying the coins, you will need to transfer them to a digital wallet or use a third-party service like [Coinbase](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/coinbase-what-it-and-how-do-you-use-it/>) to store your coins. 
If you only want to buy cryptocurrency as an investment, you may be able to do so [through your brokerage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/the-best-online-brokers-for-crypto-trading-8765274>). For example, Robinhood allows users to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, although you cannot withdraw them from the platform for purchases. In addition, there are several crypto ETFs that provide exposure to the crypto asset class without requiring the investors to maintain their own wallets. For instance, as of May 2024, investors may choose to hold [Bitcoin futures ETF](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/investing/bitcoin-etfs-explained/>) shares. The SEC has also approved the listing and trading of Ether spot shares.9
##  Is Cryptocurrency Legal? 
[Fiat currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp>) derive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. For example, the U.S. dollar is recognized and issued by the government as the official currency of the United States and is "legal tender." 
But cryptocurrencies are not issued by any public or private entities. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their [legal status in different financial jurisdictions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121515/bitcoin-legal-us.asp>) throughout the world. It doesn't help matters that cryptocurrencies have primarily functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure. 
###  In the U.S. 
The legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, the [Financial Action Task Force (FATF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-action-task-force-fatf.asp>) recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance.10
Although cryptocurrencies are considered a form of money, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats them as financial assets or property for tax purposes. And, as with most other investments, if you reap capital gains selling or trading cryptocurrencies, the government wants a piece of the profits. How exactly the IRS taxes digital assets—either as capital gains or ordinary income—depends on how long the taxpayer held the cryptocurrency and how they used it.11
In the United States in July 2023, courts ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered securities when purchased by institutional buyers but not by retail investors purchased on exchanges.12
Enthusiasts called it a victory for crypto; however, crypto exchanges are regulated by the SEC, as are coin offerings or sales to institutional investors. So, crypto is legal in the U.S., but regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry. 
As of June 2024, [El Salvador](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/el-salvador-accepts-bitcoin-as-legal-tender-5200470>) is the only country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender for monetary transactions.13 In the rest of the world, [cryptocurrency regulation varies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/cryptocurrency-regulations-around-the-world-5202122>) by jurisdiction.
###  In Asia 
Japan's Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin as legal property. Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country are required to collect information about the customer and details relating to the wire transfer.14
China has [banned cryptocurrency exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-price-tumbles-as-chinese-notices-roil-market-5202739>), transactions, and mining within its borders, but has a [Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp>).15
India was reported to be formulating a framework for cryptocurrencies, but until it is enacted, crypto is not yet illegal. Exchanges are free to offer cryptocurrencies.16
###  In Europe 
Cryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union. Derivatives and other products that use cryptocurrencies must qualify as "financial instruments." In June 2023, the European Commission's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation went into effect. This law sets safeguards and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies.17
##  Is Cryptocurrency a Safe Investment? 
Cryptocurrencies have attracted a [reputation as unstable investments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/question-why-should-anyone-invest-crypto/>) due to high investor losses from scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure, [the technical complexity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/analyze-crypto-6456223>) of using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users. 
In addition to the [market risks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketrisk.asp>) associated with speculative assets, cryptocurrency investors should be aware of the following risks: 
  * **User risk** : Unlike traditional finance, there is no way to reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent. By some estimates, about one-fifth of all bitcoins are now inaccessible due to lost passwords or incorrect sending addresses.18
  * **Regulatory risks** : The regulatory status of some cryptocurrencies is still unclear in many areas, with some governments seeking to regulate them as securities, currencies, or both. A sudden regulatory crackdown could make it challenging to sell cryptocurrencies or cause a market-wide price drop.
  * **Counterparty risks** :Many investors and merchants rely on exchanges or other custodians to store their cryptocurrency. Theft or loss by one of these third parties could result in losing one's entire investment.
  * **Management risks** : Due to the lack of coherent regulations, there are few protections against deceptive or unethical management practices. Many investors have lost large sums to management teams that failed to deliver a product.
  * **Programming risks** :Many investment and lending platforms use automated smart contracts to control the movement of user deposits. An investor using one of these platforms assumes the risk that a bug or exploit in these programs could cause them to lose their investment.
  * **Market Manipulation** :Market manipulation remains a substantial problem in cryptocurrency, with influential people, organizations, and exchanges acting unethically.


Despite these risks, cryptocurrencies have seen a significant price leap, with the total market capitalization rising to about $2.4 trillion.19 Despite the asset's speculative nature, some have created substantial fortunes by taking on the risk of investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies. 
##  Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency 
Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation. 
Advantages
  * Removes single points of failure
  * Easier to transfer funds between parties
  * Removes third parties
  * Can be used to generate returns
  * Remittances are streamlined


Disadvantages
  * Transactions are pseudonymous
  * Pseudonymity allows for criminal uses
  * Have become highly centralized
  * Expensive to participate in a network and earn
  * Off-chain security issues
  * Prices are very volatile


###  Advantages Explained 
Cryptocurrencies represent [a new, decentralized paradigm for money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/question-why-should-anyone-invest-crypto/>). In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure—such as a large financial institution setting off a cascade of global crises, such as the one triggered in 2008 by the failure of large investment banks in the U.S. 
Cryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralized [transfers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transfer.asp>) are secured by the use of [public keys](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-key.asp>) and [private keys](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp>) and different forms of incentive systems, such as [proof of work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp>) or [proof of stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp>). 
Because they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties can be faster than standard money transfers. Flash loans in [decentralized finance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835>) are an excellent example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without requiring collateral, can be executed within seconds and are mostly used in trading. 
The [remittance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/r/remittance.asp>) economy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin [serve as intermediate currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/bitcoins-best-use-isnt-currency-its-overseas-remittances/>) to streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders, and subsequently converted to the destination fiat currency without third-party involvement. 
###  Disadvantages Explained 
Though they [claim to be an anonymous form of transaction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/top-bitcoin-myths/>), cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can follow. This opens up the possibility for governments, authorities, and others to track financial transactions. 
Cryptocurrencies have become a popular tool with criminals for nefarious activities such as money laundering and illicit purchases. The case of [Dread Pirate Roberts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/ross-ulbricht-dark-net-pirate/>), who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known.20 Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities.21
In theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain. Ownership is becoming more concentrated, as witnessed by companies purchasing and holding them for price appreciation and investment fund managers buying them to hold in their funds. 
One of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However, [mining popular cryptocurrencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/news/how-get-established-cryptocurrency-miner/>) requires considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume. The expensive energy costs and the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms whose revenues run into billions of dollars. 
Only 61 (1%) of the 4,568 Bitcoin blocks opened from May 15, 2024, to June 15, 2024, were opened by unknown addresses. The other 99% were opened by mining pools.22
Though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins.23
Cryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility, so investments [require accurate price monitoring](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/comparison-cryptocurrency-price-trackers/>). For example, Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later.24 Bitcoin prices had roared back by mid-2024. As a result of this vast range of volatility, many people consider cryptocurrencies a [speculative bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculativebubble.asp>). 
## Is Crypto Actually a Good Investment?
Crypto can be a good investment for someone who enjoys speculating and can financially tolerate losing everything invested. However, it is not a wise investment for someone seeking to grow their retirement portfolio or for placing savings into it for growth.
## Is Crypto Real Money?
One definition of money is something that is generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure or store of value, and a unit of account. By this definition, cryptocurrency is real money.
## How Does Crypto Make You Money?
There are several ways cryptocurrency can make money for you. Decentralized finance applications let you loan your crypto with interest; you can stake a compatible one on a blockchain or at certain exchanges for rewards, or you can hold on to it and hope its market value increases. None of these methods are guaranteed to make money, but many people have benefitted from them.
##  The Bottom Line 
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative, and it is important to [understand the risks involved](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/<https:/www.investopedia.com/who-is-willy-woo-5235816>) before investing.
