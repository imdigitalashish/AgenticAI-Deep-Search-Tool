While the company has gone fully remote, its head office is in San Francisco, CA.34 Aside from its digital presence, [Kraken](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/kraken-review-5208448>) operates worldwide in over 190 countries, services over 10 million clients, and has established itself as one of the premier cryptocurrency exchanges that offer the best low-fee service.5
Depending on the user's 30-day trading volume, Kraken clients pay maker fees between 0.00% and 0.25% and taker fees between 0.10% and 0.40%. Other fees, such as deposit and address setup fees, come at no extra cost.6 In addition to its low-fee structure, Kraken offers a unique service that caters to multiple types of clients at various skill levels. 
For instance, Kraken’s regular platform enables beginning and low-volume traders to start trading and storing their cryptocurrency with a $10 minimum deposit, access to over 300 cryptocurrencies, an excellent selection of educational and news content, and the ability to create and utilize Kraken's exclusive wallet.7 Advanced traders who need more sophisticated features should consider Kraken Pro. This platform is designed for traders who need access to advanced order types, charting, and screening capabilities not offered on the original platform.8
The Kraken Pro's best feature is that it’s free to use and adheres to the same fee structure as the basic platform, so advanced traders don’t have to worry about extra costs. However, Kraken comes with potential drawbacks. While Kraken operates in many countries, the exchange is not available in all 50 U.S. states, such as Washington, New York, and Maine. Furthermore, in many other states, additional restrictions apply to activities such as staking, payment services, funding, and custody. Prospective clients interested in a specific service should check if it is legal in their respective state.9 It’s also important to note that Kraken does not offer any insurance for its users.10

Why We Chose It
###  Best For Security 
Gemini is our top choice for security due to its sound security standards, commitment to compliance, and third-party audits that ensure its security infrastructure operates at a high level. It’s also one of the few crypto exchanges to offer FDIC and crypto insurance to help further safeguard traders’ accounts. 
###  Best for Experienced Traders 
In addition to being our choice for security, Gemini is also our top choice for experienced traders due to Gemini’s ActiveTrader software. The platform offers experienced users the ability to conduct advanced charting techniques, use advanced [order types](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order.asp>), and trade futures and perpetual contracts.11
Pros & Cons
Pros
  * Highly secure and compliant platform
  * Available in all 50 U.S. states
  * Pass-through FDIC insurance for uninvested cash and crypto insurance


Cons
  * Offers a low number of cryptocurrencies
  * Customer support only has a request form
  * Complex fee structure


Overview
Gemini was founded in 2014 and is currently headquartered in New York, N.Y.12 Due to its high-security standards, Gemini is our choice for users who value security for their cryptocurrency holdings. By default, users’ accounts are equipped with two-factor authentication. However, Gemini also supports external hardware security keys such as Yubikey to secure accounts further.13
Gemini holds most customer assets in offshore cold storage, and it works to facilitate easy transfers of assets between the exchange and consumer wallets. Gemini also subjects itself to routine third-party audits and claims to have completed SOC 1 and SOC 2 Type 2 exams, in addition to earning its ISO 27001 certification.14 Users also have the option to store their cryptocurrency in either Gemini’s hot wallet, which is insured, or its cold wallet.15
Gemini is also our choice for experienced crypto traders. While high-net-worth individuals can enjoy its high-security standards, they can also appreciate the advanced software it offers with its trademarked tool, ActiveTrader. Even though it offers less than 80 cryptocurrencies, a low amount for a major crypto exchange, Gemini’s ActiveTrader deserves recognition as a highly advanced platform capable of reaching trade execution speeds of 65 microseconds. Experienced traders also have access to high-risk assets such as perpetual contracts, crypto futures, and indices.16 ActiveTrader also provides advanced charting and order types that further assist traders in their cryptocurrency ventures.11
Gemini does have some drawbacks. Its fee structure, at first glance, appears reasonable. Depending on your 30-day trade volume, maker fees can range from 0.00% to 0.20%, while taker fees can range from 0.03% to 0.40%. However, the order type you use to execute a trade can trigger more fees, in addition to a 2.50% fiat transfer fee for using PayPal and a $25 wire transfer fee for withdrawals.1718 Customer support should also be noted, as traders must submit a form to deal with issues like account management and fraud.19
###  Best for Beginners :  Coinbase
Coinbase
  * **Minimum deposit:** $0.00
  * **Maker fees:** 0.00% to 0.40%
  * **Taker fees:** 0.05% to 0.60%

Why We Chose It
Coinbase is best for beginners due to its sleek user interface, solid security infrastructure, and a reasonable fee structure that is easy to understand. While Coinbase offers an excellent service for investors new to crypto trading, the company also provides more advanced features, which are nonetheless vital for beginning crypto traders. With Coinbase's comprehensive educational resources, beginners can enhance their skills and utilize Coinbase’s more [advanced trading tools](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/121014/best-technical-analysis-trading-software.asp>) when they are ready without having to jump to another exchange that caters to more experienced traders. 
Pros & Cons
Pros
  * Excellent educational and research resources
  * Reasonable fee structure and a good selection of cryptocurrency
  * Available in 172 countries and offers access to web, desktop, and mobile platforms


Cons
  * It may not be a good fit for established traders
  * Does not offer margin or option trading and only provides future trading on select crypto
  * Must chat or request a call when contacting customer service


Overview
Coinbase is headquartered in San Francisco and was founded in 2012, which is coincidentally the year [Bitcoin gained serious traction](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/121815/bitcoins-price-history.asp>).20 Since its inception as a cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase has become one of the premier leaders in the cryptocurrency space and has done the one thing many crypto exchanges fail to do: cater to beginner crypto investors. 
Cryptocurrency is a complicated alternative investment that requires careful study by traders. However, Coinbase’s educational resources, which cover basic and advanced trading topics, can help clarify its complexity.21 In addition, Coinbase offers two charting versions: a basic and an advanced version. 
The basic version is a simple chart with essential data such as market cap, volume, and other metrics that beginning traders will find valuable. However, it does not provide any charting tools, which is why Coinbase also has an advanced version.22 The advanced version offers charting features such as Fibonacci, drawing tools, and projections. Even with advanced trading software, Coinbase may not be a great fit even for experienced traders, as the exchange lacks options and margin trading and only offers futures trading on specific coins. 
Investors who open an account with Coinbase will see it has a reasonable fee structure. Its maker fee ranges between 0.00% to 0.40%, and its taker fees are 0.05% to 0.60%. Also, users can trade more than 240 cryptocurrencies while being able to survey over 18,000 digital assets.23 While Coinbase provides web, desktop, and mobile platforms, its customer service could be better.24 Users can contact a service rep through chat or request a call for further assistance.25
###  Best Mobile App,  Best for Bitcoin :  Crypto.com
Crypto.com
  * **Minimum deposit:** $20
  * **Maker fees:** 0.00% to 0.25% 
  * **Taker fees:** 0.05% to 0.5% 
  * **Available cryptocurrencies:** 417

Why We Chose It
###  Best Mobile App 
Crypto.com is our choice for the best mobile app provider due to its major focus on its mobile platform and all that that entails. Crypto traders can buy, sell, use, and trade crypto from the palms of their hands. 
###  Best for Bitcoin 
Crypto.com is also our choice for Bitcoin traders and investors due to its reasonable fee structure and excellent security infrastructure, which is important to many Bitcoin investors and users. Crypto.com provides Bitcoin options and futures for Bitcoin derivative traders. 
Pros & Cons
Pros
  * Allows Bitcoin options and futures
  * Reasonable fee structure and a good selection of cryptocurrency
  * Excellent mobile platform and debit card program


Cons
  * Available in fewer than 100 countries
  * Only offers chat service for assistance
  * Crypto.com only provides access to a hot wallet


Overview
Crypto.com, headquartered in the Central Region of Singapore, boasts an impressive customer base of over 100 million users in more than 90 countries, which isn’t bad for a company that was founded in 2016.2627 The main reason why Crypto.com is so popular goes far beyond its marketing campaigns. It's one of the best crypto exchanges for mobile-first traders and Bitcoin holders. 
Mobile users considering crypto.com can expect a sleek and fully intuitive mobile platform that offers more than convenience. Mobile users have access to more than 400 cryptocurrencies. Depending on eligible cryptocurrency, users can earn rewards through Crypto.com’s Earn program and its Staking program.2829 In addition to buying, selling, and using cryptocurrency as well as trading derivatives, Crypto.com also provides its mobile users with sophisticated trading features, allowing them to automate their trades. Furthermore, Crypto.com includes access to its Visa debit card, a cryptocurrency-connected card enabling users to easily use their crypto to buy goods and services on the private market.30
Along with its mobile capabilities, Crypto.com is also best for Bitcoin. The platform offers a wide array of trading, from derivatives to regular long-term investments. The company has a reasonable fee structure, which also applies to its mobile platform. However, depending on their 30-day trade volume, users can expect maker fees to be between 0% and 0.25% and taker fees to be between 0.05% and 0.5%. There are additional benefits for VIP users who hold crypto.com’s cryptocurrency [Cronos (CRO)](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monaco-mco-cryptocurrency.asp>).31 One benefit is that it offers better rewards with its debit card. For instance, the higher the CRO count, the better the rewards. Bitcoin traders will also have access to Bitcoin options and futures, which is an important feature for traders and investors alike.32
Before users sign up for an account, they should consider the downsides. For instance, Crypto.com is not readily available in many countries. Before committing to opening an account, you should check to see if Crypto.com legally operates in your geographical location. While Crypto.com has an excellent support center to help users resolve issues on their own, it only provides access to a live chat feature for further assistance.33
###  Best for Altcoins :  Bitmart
Simply Recipes / Alison Bickel.
BitMart
  * **Minimum deposit:** Not disclosed
  * **Maker fees:** Contingent on class tier, 0.04% to 0.6%
  * **Taker fees:** Contingent on class tier, 0.045% to 0.6%
  * **Available cryptocurrencies:** Over 1,700


[Open Account](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.bitmart.com/en-US>)
Why We Chose It
Bitmart, which offers over 1,700 cryptocurrencies, is our top choice as the best crypto exchange for [altcoins](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altcoin.asp>). While the exchange lacks fundamental trading features, it's an excellent place to buy cryptocurrency that traders would normally have to access on other exchanges. 
Pros & Cons
Pros
  * Access to over 1,700 cryptocurrencies
  * Allows social trading through its copy-trading feature
  * BitMart Academy provides excellent educational resources


Cons
  * Does not display its security infrastructure
  * A complex tiered fee structure that ranges to the high side
  * Only supports crypto deposits to fund account


Overview
BitMart, founded in 2017 and headquartered in New York, N.Y., is our top choice for altcoins due to its accessibility to over 1,700 tradable cryptocurrencies.34 While still offering access to the most important coins on the market, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, it provides other coins that may be difficult to find on some other exchanges. It's important to note that cryptocurrency poses significant risks even with established digital coins. Smaller, less established coins pose even more risks, with liquidity and market manipulation being a serious concern for crypto holders.35
BitMart also offers its users an interesting way to trade cryptocurrency: copy trading. BitMart users can access some statistics for its top traders and see such metrics as their [returns on investment (ROI)](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp>) for cryptos they traded, along with their trading history and current trade positions. However, traders should bear in mind that past success does not lead automatically to future gains, and they should proceed cautiously.36 While BitMart has advanced charting capabilities, it’s only for futures trading.37 In addition, BitMart does not offer some of the order types that certain competitors offer. To date, BitMart only provides two order types: market and limit orders.38
Through BitMart Academy, the exchange offers excellent educational resources that cover various topics, from basic knowledge to more complex subjects. While it offers a robust selection of crypto, there are some drawbacks. Its fee structure is complex, to say the least. For instance, the classification you fall into and your 30-day trading volume determine the fees associated with the crypto you buy and sell. Prospective clients should study Bitmart’s fee chart and understand it before opening an account. Nonetheless, most of Bitmart’s maker fees are between 0.04% to 0.6%. Most of its taker fees are between 0.045% to 0.6%.39 In addition, the only way to fund a new account is to transfer crypto from a wallet or another exchange.40
BitMart claims to have an advanced risk control system with multi-signature technologies and a hybrid hot and cold wallet storage.41 Unlike some competitors, BitMart does not reveal its security infrastructure for users' accounts. For instance, it does not publicly state its security certifications or disclose whether it subjects itself to third-party audits. We can confirm that the company equips users with multifactor authentication.42

## More details on why these platforms made the cut
### **Coinbase**
[![Coinbase](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=85/cdn/investing/logos/Coinbase_Wordmark.png)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/redirect/0704d468-0e35-11eb-a08b-77640ee38baf>)

[Learn moreon partner's site](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/redirect/0704d468-0e35-11eb-a08b-77640ee38baf>)
on Coinbase's website
**KEY FACTS**
  * **Trading fees:** 0%-3.99%
  * **Number of cryptocurrencies offered:** 280+. 
  * **Staking or rewards program:** Yes.


**Best for:** Overall best crypto exchange; beginner crypto trading; hassle-free and secure crypto storage.
**Why we picked it:** Coinbase has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency trading since it was founded in 2012, paving the way for beginners who had previously been skeptical of decentralized wallets and how to use them. And that ethos continues to this day — Coinbase is consistently one of the most user-friendly crypto apps we review, even when using its more advanced trading features. This makes it a strong choice for beginners looking for an onramp into the world of crypto.
**Good to know:** Coinbase's fee structure can sometimes be quite confusing, though you'll see all fees displayed clearly before placing any order. And though Coinbase says it provides 24-hour customer service by phone, chat and email, in our testing it was very difficult to contact a human. 
**Coinbase's app reviews:** Two of the most prominent themes among positive reviews of Coinbase are the app's ease of use and its learning rewards program. The learn-to-earn program lets users earn cryptocurrency by watching videos and completing quizzes about them, and receives very high marks. In fact, over half the reviews mention this feature as a plus. However, users also pointed out Coinbase's relatively high fees, and many expressed issues with customer service and noted it was very difficult to resolve issues and contact the company. This is in line with NerdWallet's testing; we had a very hard time reaching the company and found the process confusing. 
### **Robinhood Crypto**
[![Robinhood Crypto](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=85/cdn/investing/logos/ROBINHLOGO.png)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/redirect/7272b996-ba55-11eb-983b-bff3fba2d823>)
[NerdWallet rating ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/robinhood>)
[Learn moreon partner's site](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/redirect/7272b996-ba55-11eb-983b-bff3fba2d823>)
on Robinhood's website
**KEY FACTS**
  * **Trading fees:** $0
  * **Number of cryptocurrencies offered:** 40+.
  * **Staking or rewards program:** Yes, on Solana (SOL) and Ether (ETH).


**Best for:** Easily buying and selling crypto with USD; best crypto exchange among traditional online brokers. 
**Why we picked it:** When Robinhood initially launched its crypto trading product, it was barebones and lacked many features central to crypto trading, such as the ability to send and receive coins. But over time, Robinhood has improved the offering, bringing its incredibly easy stock user interface to crypto markets. While it still can't compete with the pure-play crypto platforms on this list, Robinhood Crypto is a solid choice for those looking for an app that features crypto and stocks all in one.
**Good to know:** The crypto offering available in the Robinhood brokerage app has limitations. For example, you can't trade crypto-to-crypto directly. For that, you'll need to set up a separate Robinhood Wallet. 
**Robinhood Crypto's app reviews:** In evaluating this, we looked only at reviews that mentioned cryptocurrency, and we found the sentiment is very similar to reviews of the investment platform as a whole. There's a large swath who appreciate how easy the app is to use and how great it is for getting started with investing, yet complaints about the app freezing or crashing as people try to make trades are also common. We should note we have not experienced this in our testing of the crypto portion of the app. Many users also expressed frustration around poor customer support for crypto-related inquiries. 
### **Gemini**
[![Gemini](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=85/cdn/investing/logos/gemini.png)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/redirect/2ea180fa-90c8-11eb-8af6-b3ed7f26e703>)
[NerdWallet rating ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/gemini>)
[Learn moreon partner's site](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/redirect/2ea180fa-90c8-11eb-8af6-b3ed7f26e703>)
on Gemini's website
**KEY FACTS**
  * **Trading fees:** 0.5%-3.49%
  * **Number of cryptocurrencies offered:** 80+
  * **Staking or rewards program:** On Polygon (MATIC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL).


**Best for:** Advanced and active crypto trading; crypto-to-crypto trading. 
**Why we picked it:** Gemini offers products for all levels of crypto trading, but its ActiveTrader product is especially suited for advanced crypto traders. The platform provides access to crypto derivatives, boasts an execution speed of microseconds and offers a selection of some of the most popular crypto-to-crypto trading pairs, even if it the selection isn't as expansive as some other platforms.
**Good to know:** Gemini previously offered a staking and rewards program called Gemini Earn, but in November 2022, froze customer assets amid the fallout from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. However, by June 2024, Gemini announced that it had returned 100% of the assets that it owed back to customers[0]. 
**Gemini's app reviews** : Positive reviews of Gemini mention the simplicity of the app and how easy it is to use, and many users noted the wide selection of quality crypto assets. We found this to be a noteworthy distinction: Gemini does not offer the most cryptocurrencies, but for users who aren't interested in getting access to the latest meme coin, that may not matter. 
However, the app did get low marks for its high fees, and many users complained about problems withdrawing funds and verifying their account through Gemini's 2FA process. In our testing, weren't able to recreate any of these access or withdrawal issues; however, we did find that for anyone remotely new to cryptocurrency, the withdrawal and verification processes could be confusing and frustrating. We should also note reviews have skewed negatively over the course of the last 12 months, and that while some users praised Gemini's customer service, there's been an increase in the number of negative reviews that mention poor customer service in the last year. 
### **Kraken**
[![Kraken](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=85/cdn/investing/logos/Kraken.png)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/kraken>)
[NerdWallet rating ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/kraken>)
[Read review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/kraken>)
**KEY FACTS**
  * **Trading fees:** 0.16%-5%
  * **Number of cryptocurrencies offered:** 200+
  * **Staking or rewards program:** 17 assets, including ETH, SOL, DOT and ADA, via Kraken Pro. 


**Best for:** Low fees for advanced trading; large selection of cryptocurrencies; crypto-to-crypto trading pairs.
**Why we picked it:** Kraken offers a huge selection of cryptocurrencies and around 100 crypto-to-crypto trading pairs. And if you're trading on Kraken Pro, fees fall to some of the lowest of any crypto exchange we review. We also found Kraken's 24-hour customer support to be straightforward and were able to easily contact a human by phone. 
**Good to know:** The exchange is not available for users in New York or Washington. As of March 3, 2025, Kraken has resumed its staking program for U.S. customers in 37 states through its Kraken Pro offering. NerdWallet is reviewing this product and will update the [Kraken review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/kraken>) accordingly. 
**Kraken's app reviews:** App users tend to mention how intuitive Kraken's app is, and many also spotlighted how fast transactions take place. Users also noted Kraken's wide selection of cryptocurrencies as a plus, and praised the app's strong security protocols and customer service. Interestingly, Kraken appears to have a very divided audience: around three-quarters of the reviews are 5-stars, while around one-quarter are 1-star reviews. Only 6% of reviews in the last year were 2, 3 or 4 star ratings. Still, despite this polarization, positive reviews far exceed negative reviews. And in our exercise of combing through user reviews of other platforms, the praise we saw for Kraken's customer service is very rare.
### **Crypto.com**
[![Crypto.com](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=85/cdn/investing/logos/crypto.com.png)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/crypto-com>)
[NerdWallet rating ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/crypto-com>)
[Read review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/crypto-com>)
**KEY FACTS**
  * **Trading fees:** 0%-2.99%
  * **Number of cryptocurrencies offered:** 350+
  * **Staking or rewards program:** Yes.


**Best for:** Overall experience; cryptocurrency selection. 
**Why we picked it:** Crypto.com rose to the top of the ranks thanks to its huge selection of digital assets, low fees, DeFi companion app and slick user experience. For more advanced traders, the platform offers trading in crypto derivatives, as well as customizable alerts and watchlists. Beginners will find plenty of explanations and tooltips along the way.
**Good to know:** The fees and minimum to withdrawal cryptocurrency can be high. 
**Crypto.com's app reviews:** Users like how easy it is to use the app, and many noted they liked Crypto.com's added security features and 2FA. This tracks with our experience, as we found that the additional security features (such as using a pin to complete transactions) weren't inconvenient, and added to security. However, there were several users who were annoyed about how frequently the app requires updates, which can take a long time to complete. More notable, in our opinion, were the negative reviews based on withdrawal issues and long processing times. We also experienced this when testing these users' claims; after what at first appeared to be an error, we learned Crypto.com's BTC withdrawal minimum was .0008 BTC at the time of testing, or around $75, and we were unable to get our BTC off the platform without hitting that threshold. 
### **Fidelity Crypto**
[![Fidelity Crypto](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=85/cdn/investing/logos/FidNewLogo.png)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/fidelity>)
[NerdWallet rating ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/fidelity>)
[Read review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/fidelity>)
**KEY FACTS**
  * **Trading fees:** 1% spread
  * **Number of cryptocurrencies offered:** 3
  * **Staking or rewards program:** None.


**Best for:** Investors who want basic exposure to cryptocurrency within a traditional brokerage
**Why we picked it:** Investors who already use Fidelity and want to gain some exposure to three cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin — can now do so from within the brokerage. Functionality is limited, and you won't find any advanced crypto trading bells and whistles, but for many using this product, such offerings aren't necessary. 
**Good to know:** Despite operating through one of the largest brokerages in the U.S., Fidelity Crypto is still only available in 38 states.
**Fidelity Crypto's app reviews:** There are so few Fidelity reviews that mention its crypto product, there isn't a way to appropriately determine sentiment among users. 
### **InteractiveBrokers Crypto**
[![Interactive Brokers Crypto](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=85/cdn/investing/logos/InteractiveBrokers.png)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/interactive-brokers>)
[NerdWallet rating ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/interactive-brokers>)
[Read review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/interactive-brokers>)
**KEY FACTS**
  * **Trading fees:** Up to 1%
  * **Number of cryptocurrencies offered:** 4
  * **Staking or rewards program:** None.


**Best for:** Traditional brokers; advanced traders.
**Why we picked it:** InteractiveBrokers has long been one of the best brokers for advanced trading in equities, and now it offers a similar platform for cryptocurrency. Similar to Fidelity's crypto offering, existing users of InteractiveBrokers will appreciate the ability to gain exposure to four large cryptocurrencies within the platform. 
**Good to know:** InteractiveBrokers is still primarily an advanced stock trading platform, so you won't be able to trade crypto-to-crypto like you can on a pure-play crypto trading platform, such as Coinbase, Gemini, Crypto.com or Kraken. 
**Interactive Brokers' app reviews:** Interactive Brokers is internationally known for its robust trading platform built for advanced stock traders. So it wasn't a surprise to learn reviews of the platform scarcely mention crypto trading. Those that do mention cryptocurrency appear to be from regions where IBKR limits crypto trading access. However, this should not be an issue for U.S.-based traders. 
### **Uphold**
[![Uphold](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=85/cdn/investing/logos/UpholdLogo2.png)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/uphold>)
[NerdWallet rating ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/uphold>)
[Read review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/uphold>)
**KEY FACTS**
  * **Trading fees:** 1.4%-1.6%
  * **Number of cryptocurrencies offered:** Over 300
  * **Staking or rewards program:** Around 20 coins with top yields over 15%


**Best for:** Crypto pair traders and stakers.
**Why we picked it:** For seasoned crypto investors, Uphold offers hundreds of cryptocurrencies, tens of thousands of crypto trading pairs and dozens of coins for staking. It also offers three different hot wallet options, and allows users to transfer crypto to a cold wallet of their choice. For beginners, there's also a library of educational content and low trading minimums.
**Good to know:** Uphold's transaction fee for Bitcoin could be lower. Also, like many other crypto platforms, it only offers email customer service and a chatbot; there's no live human support option if you run into a technical issue.
**Uphold's app reviews:** Uphold app reviews are largely positive, with many users pointing out that the interface is easy to use and that transactions on the platform are fast and reliable. Users also tend to comment on the wide selection of cryptocurrencies. Negative views typically reference poor customer service and slow response times, which is fairly common among reviews of crypto apps whose customer service is primarily (or entirely) offered through email and chat. 
  * How we collect real user sentiment about crypto apps
NerdWallet's evaluations focus on data we collect about crypto exchanges, including fees, platform and cryptocurrency selection, as well as our own testers' experiences. We include two factors that directly address customer service: Support availability and contact methods, and website transparency, which our team assesses by looking for key information on the provider's website, just as a potential customer would. For mobile apps, we also consider the app's overall rating in both iOS and Android stores. But qualitative customer satisfaction is harder for us to directly assess. To offer a more complete evaluation, we've used an AI tool to comb crypto app reviews from the iOS and Android app stores. We then evaluate that data for consistent themes, both positive and negative. Due to the anonymous nature, we're unable to confirm these customer experiences as we normally would. The summaries below are based on up to a year's worth of reviews ending February 24, 2025.


## Common questions about cryptocurrency exchanges
### **What is a crypto exchange?**
A crypto exchange is, very basically, a place where you can purchase a cryptocurrency using cash or another digital asset.
This roundup primarily discusses a type of crypto exchange known as a centralized exchange. A centralized exchange is a marketplace operated by a business entity that buys, sells and facilitates transactions in cryptocurrency.
If you're new to cryptocurrency or just need to convert fiat currency into crypto, you'll likely use a centralized exchange.
Another way to get crypto is through what is known as a decentralized exchange. These are largely automated, blockchain-based programs that allow users to swap certain kinds of cryptocurrency for one another. While these can have lower transaction costs, they also require more technical expertise. And if you don't already have cryptocurrency, your options are limited.
### **How do I choose the****r****i****g****h****t****crypto exchange?**
One of the biggest factors in picking a crypto exchange is the type of cryptocurrency you plan to invest in, and how far from the mainstream you want to stray. [Bitcoin](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-is-bitcoin>) and a handful of the biggest altcoins like Ethereum are nearly universally available, and may be the only cryptocurrencies on the menu at online brokers. If you're interested in these and merely want to dabble in crypto, an online broker may be a good fit — one added benefit is you can keep your cryptocurrency and other investments within one platform. 
But if you are eyeing a niche coin, you’ll want to double-check its availability on any exchange you're considering. Pure-play crypto exchanges will offer the widest variety of cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency pairs. 
Then consider where you want to store your crypto once you've purchased it: Storage options vary from exchange to exchange, and the presence or absence of your preferred storage method could be a reason to choose one service over another.
Generally, you can store crypto with the exchange where you bought it. Most — though not all — exchanges also let you move the digital assets you buy to your own [crypto wallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/best-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-wallet>). If that's important to you, be sure to select an exchange that supports it. 
Finally, consider other major factors like fees, the trading experience and — if you're new to crypto trading — the level of educational resources provided to help you get started. 
### **What services do crypto exchanges offer?**
Aside from their primary role at the center of crypto sales and purchases, exchanges have added a handful of other offerings. Among those are services that pay rewards to people who lend out their crypto. Many crypto exchanges will hold your crypto for you if you don't want to set up a wallet that you control by yourself.
### **Which crypto exchange offers the largest selection?**
The number of coins on offer at crypto exchanges can vary widely. If you're looking to trade a specific cryptocurrency, you'll want to confirm it's available through the platform you're interested in. Generally speaking, if you're looking for anything more than Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, you should probably consider a pure-play crypto exchange rather than a traditional broker with a crypto offering. This becomes clear when comparing the number of cryptocurrencies available at pure-play crypto platforms and traditional brokers above.
### **Where can I buy the TRUMP meme coin?**
Several of the exchanges above offer the TRUMP meme token that was launched in January 2025, including Coinbase and Robinhood. Keep in mind that while the coin quickly increased in value and market cap immediately following its launch, its price is likely to be highly volatile. This is true of all cryptocurrencies, but especially [meme coins](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/meme-coins>), which are driven by news or pop culture trends and are prone to large price explosions or crashes. Generally speaking, investors should treat meme coins like TRUMP as highly speculative. 
### **Are crypto exchanges safe?**
Crypto trading is not subject to the same investor protections you get when working with traditional investments. For example, U.S. Securities Investor Protection Corp. insurance doesn't apply to cryptocurrency, so if your exchange fails, you could lose your investment.
It's also worth noting that storing crypto in an exchange's wallet can leave you vulnerable to losses if an exchange fails or suffers a cyberattack. For this reason, some users prefer not to store assets on exchanges unless they're actively trading. 
### **How much money do I need to use a crypto exchange?**
If you're just thinking about dabbling in crypto, it's good to remember that you don't have to put your life's savings on the line to get a sense of how it works.
Crypto exchanges reviewed by NerdWallet generally have no account minimums, which means you're free to create an account and look around without spending a dime. And if you decide to buy some crypto, you don't have to buy a lot. Many exchanges have a minimum purchase of around a dollar.
### **How is investing in crypto different from investing in stocks?**
Trading cryptocurrencies is different from traditional investing in several ways. A few examples:
  * Compared to traditional investing, which has seen fees steadily decline in recent years, trading in cryptocurrencies costs much more. For example, depending on the method of payment, you could pay 5% or more in fees when trading Bitcoin. Most online brokers no longer charge a commission to trade stocks.
  * Crypto is still a relatively new and burgeoning industry, and customer service has lagged behind what's available at traditional brokerages. Want to speak to a person concerning questions or account issues at a crypto exchange? Many pure crypto exchanges don't offer that service.
  * You have more responsibility for protecting your crypto from theft with cryptocurrency exchanges, especially if you use your own digital wallet. While exchanges protect you from losses due to site-wide hacks, you won’t be protected from individual attacks on your account — for example, a phishing email attack in which you unwittingly reveal your passwords to cybercriminals.

### Methodology
How do we review cryptocurrency platforms?
NerdWallet’s comprehensive review process evaluates and ranks platforms and companies that allow U.S. customers to buy and/or sell cryptocurrency. Our aim is to provide an independent assessment of providers to help arm you with information to make sound, informed judgements on which ones will best meet your needs. We adhere to strict guidelines for [editorial integrity.](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/l/editorial-guidelines>)
We collect data directly from providers through detailed questionnaires, and conduct first-hand testing and observation through provider demonstrations. The questionnaire answers, combined with demonstrations, interviews of personnel at the providers and our specialists’ hands-on research, fuel our proprietary assessment process that scores each provider’s performance across more than 20 factors. The final output produces star ratings from poor (one star) to excellent (five stars).
For more details about the categories considered when rating crypto platforms and our process, [read our full methodology](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/<https:/www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-crypto-platforms>).

NerdWallet has an engagement with Atomic Invest, LLC (“Atomic Invest”), an SEC-registered investment adviser, to bring you the opportunity to open an investment advisory account (“Atomic Treasury account”). Investment advisory services are provided by Atomic Invest. Companies which are engaged by Atomic Invest receive compensation of 0% to 0.85% annualized, payable monthly, based upon assets under management for each referred client who establishes an account with Atomic Invest (i.e., exact payment will differ). Atomic Invest also shares a percentage of compensation received from margin interest and free cash interest earned by customers with NerdWallet. NerdWallet is not a client of Atomic Invest, but our engagement with Atomic Invest gives us an incentive to refer you to Atomic Invest instead of another investment adviser. This conflict of interest affects our ability to provide you with unbiased, objective information about the services of Atomic Invest. This could mean that the services of another investment adviser with whom we are not engaged could be more appropriate for you than Atomic Invest. Advisory services through Atomic Invest are designed to assist clients in achieving a favorable outcome in their investment portfolio. They are not intended to provide tax advice or financial planning with respect to every aspect of a client’s financial situation and do not include investments that clients may hold outside of Atomic Invest.

Crypto staking allows owners of cryptocurrency to earn a return on their holdings, paying them more cryptocurrency. The easiest way to do that for the owners of major [cryptocurrencies](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-cryptocurrency/>) is by working with one of the best crypto exchanges for staking. These exchanges make staking easy for everyone and make it possible for those with small crypto positions to enjoy staking rewards.
Here are the top crypto staking platforms of 2025 and some of their key details.
## What is crypto staking?
Cryptocurrencies must validate the transactions on their platforms, and many use those who have a direct stake in the crypto to do so. These currencies use “proof-of-stake” validation to verify transactions in the [blockchain database](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-blockchain/>). Usually, a currency’s owners must have a minimum amount of the crypto coin to be able to act as a validator and approve transactions.
For helping to regulate the cryptocurrency, validators are paid with some of the cryptocurrency. However, if validators approve a fraudulent transaction that doesn’t meet the cryptocurrency’s rules, they could lose some of their investment, so it’s not a riskless proposition.
Even those who don’t have enough of a stake can participate in these [staking rewards](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/crypto-staking/>), however. On their own, they can pool their resources with other crypto owners and participate, though this process may be somewhat complex. Alternatively, if their assets are held with a crypto exchange, they can stake their assets more easily and still earn an attractive return.
Many of the [most popular cryptocurrencies](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/types-of-cryptocurrency/>), such as [Ethereum](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-ethereum/>), use proof-of-stake validation, so crypto fans have quite a few choices when it comes to earning staking rewards.
## Best crypto staking platforms
The ability to stake your crypto through a crypto exchange is not a given, and the [best crypto exchanges](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-exchanges-and-trading-apps/>) let you stake many coins and charge a reasonable fee or even no fee to do so.
### Binance.US
[Binance](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/binance-review/>) has one of the largest selections of available cryptocurrencies, so it’s not too surprising that it also offers one of the largest selections of coins with staking rewards. It offers staking on Ethereum, Solana, [Cardano](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-cardano/>) and Polkadot, along with 17 other tokens. The exchange charges a service fee of 30 to 35 percent, depending on the coin, for facilitating the staking.
**Number of coins available for staking:** 21
### Coinbase
[Coinbase](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/coinbase-review/>) is another exchange that offers trading on a ton of coins — more than 200 at our last count — and offers staking rewards on eight of those coins. They include Ethereum, [Solana](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-solana/>), Cardano, Avalanche and Polkadot. Coinbase charges a fee between 25 and 35 percent, depending on the coin you’re staking, and its published rates reflect that fee already.
**Number of coins available for staking:** 8
### Gemini
[Gemini](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/gemini-review/>) offers around 80 cryptocurrencies, though clients will be able to stake just three of those: Ethereum, Solana and Polygon. Unfortunately for U.S. investors, Solana is off-limits, so they have just two options. Staking fees are relatively low, with Gemini taking a 15 percent cut of the total reward. Clients can stake any amount of cryptocurrency, with no minimum amount.
**Number of coins available for staking:** 3
### KuCoin
KuCoin offers 945 coins, a veritable smorgasbord of cryptocurrency, with 42 of those available for staking rewards. KuCoin offers the usual options for staking, including Ethereum, Solana and Cardano, as well as less typical options such as Sui and BNB. The downside for Americans is that they’re not legally permitted to be customers.
**Number of coins available for staking:** 42
### ByBit
ByBit has more than 180 cryptocurrencies available for staking rewards, and it offers different reward structures for many of them, giving crypto owners flexibility in how they earn income. ByBit also lets users earn income on Bitcoin, and it charges no fees for staking. American traders are not legally able to open an account here, however, nor are citizens of the U.K., France, mainland China and other nations.
**Number of coins available for staking:** 183
### Crypto.com
[Crypto.com](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/crypto-com-review/>) features trading in more than 350 coins by our count, and 29 of those can generate you income as part of the exchange’s Rewards+ program. It includes big names such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano and Avalanche, and Crypto.com lets you earn on [Bitcoin](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-bitcoin/>), too. Unfortunately for American crypto fans, however, staking is not available in the U.S. Crypto.com also offers among the lowest trading fees, especially if you can bring some trading volume.
**Number of coins available for staking:** 29
### Kraken
With more than 200 coins available on its platform, [Kraken](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/kraken-review/>) offers quite a buffet for crypto traders, and those looking to generate income will find a sizable selection. A total of 24 cryptocurrencies will generate returns here, including marquee names like Ethereum and Solana, as well as Tezos, Cosmos and Algorand. You can also generate income from your Bitcoin position. However, American traders will not be able to participate in Kraken’s staking program.
**Number of coins available for staking:** 24
## Bottom line
[As cryptocurrencies continue to gain in popularity](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/types-of-cryptocurrency/>), staking allows investors who help validate crypto transactions get paid in crypto. From [well-known crypto exchanges](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.bankrate.com/investing/best-online-brokers-cryptocurrency-trading/>) to smaller platforms, there are plenty of options when it comes to earning staking rewards.

Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations. 
Investors love generating passive income, but plenty of market experts claim that cryptocurrency lacks the ability to provide a source of income. That’s not entirely true. Staking (as well as a few rewards programs) can generate interest income from the crypto that you own right now.
You can earn rewards through staking by locking up your crypto to help run the blockchains that support certain cryptocurrencies. If you’re interested in staking or a crypto rewards program, picking the right crypto exchange is essential. This will ensure that you get access to the right resources and the highest yields.
To help you choose the right crypto exchange for staking and rewards, Forbes Advisor has surveyed the best crypto platforms for staking available in the U.S.

Editor's Take
[Gemini](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/gemini-review/>) supports more than 40 cryptocurrencies for earning rewards via its Gemini Earn program. While it’s not a staking program per se, Gemini Earn is a lending platform that lets users lend out their crypto holdings in exchange for interest payments.
Like staking on other crypto exchange platforms, users earn an annual percentage yield (APY) for participating with their crypto holdings. For example, at the time of this writing, you can earn 4.55% APY on your Solana holdings.
For those who want a more traditional staking program, Gemini offers staking for the following tokens: Polygon (MATIC) and Ethereum (ETH).
Pros & Cons
  * Simple, easy-to-use interface.
  * Available in every U.S. state
  * You can earn interest on stablecoins like USDC and Pax Gold (PAXG)


  * Limited customer service options
  * Ethereum and Cardano are not available for staking


### KuCoin

Editor's Take
Users can participate and earn a myriad of types of rewards with their cryptocurrency on [KuCoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/kucoin-review/>). The interest-bearing rewards range from being accrued from promotions, savings or stakings, which are all a part of KuCoin Earn. The fixed interest available on [Ethereum 2.0](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2022/03/22/ethereum-crypto-make-or-break-bull-bear/>) is nearly 4.7% annually.
Pros & Cons
  * Offers a wide selection of cryptocurrencies eligible to earn interest income.
  * You can earn interest by staking popular stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and [USD Coin (USDC)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/usd-coin/>).


  * KuCoin is not licensed in the U.S.
  * Challenging to see the differences between Kucoin Earn’s savings, staking and promotions features.

Editor's Take
Only a handful of cryptocurrencies are available on [Binance.US](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/binance-us-review/?tid=FARZj89hvQZQ3Xgm0p5vSu_wGpBDncXot1g>) for staking, and even the most popular altcoin, Ethereum, isn’t an option on this platform for staking or rewards. That said, the process of staking and interest on Binance.US is straightforward and Binance.US users can also earn rewards, interest for staking the exchange’s native coin, [Binance Coin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-binance-coin/?tid=FARZj89hvQZQ3Xgm0p5vSu_caYCBProJ41N>) (BNB).
Pros & Cons
  * Allows staking for Audius (AUDIO), Avalanche (AVAX), Binance Coin (BNB), Cosmos, Livepeer (LPT), Solana, and The Graph (GRT), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and more.


  * More cryptocurrencies (600+) and tokens for staking are available on its parent exchange Binance (which is not available in the U.S.)

## Methodology
We performed an in-depth assessment of the features and options offered by nearly 25 cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto trading apps and brokerage platforms that offer crypto trading options. To identify the best exchanges for staking, we looked at eight key variables to assess each platform:
  * **Basic Trading Features.** Key metrics included the number of cryptocurrencies available to trade, the number of fiat currencies accepted, the exchange’s overall liquidity and trading fees.
  * **Advanced Trading Features.** We looked at the availability of complex trading features like advanced order types and volume discounts for frequent trading.
  * **Platform Availability.** While some of the best crypto exchanges are available everywhere, others have widely varying degrees of accessibility to different features by country and by U.S. state.
  * **Customer Service.** Available types of customer support.
  * **Educational Resources.** We evaluated the educational content offered by each platform.
  * **Crypto Rewards Credit Card.** A few platforms offer crypto rewards credit cards.
  * **Security and Storage.** Types of storage options, security and insurance available, plus an assessment of any large-scale hacks of each exchange over its lifetime.
  * **Staking and Rewards.** Some platforms allow users to stake selected cryptos and earn interest payments.


These eight variables helped us benchmark the staking and crypto interest features, among others, of the crypto exchanges and brokerages we surveyed. The sum of weighted values across all or some of these key factors was calculated for each ranking to award each brokerage or exchange its overall rank.

##  Crypto Staking FAQs 
### What is staking?
Staking is a unique feature allowed with some cryptocurrencies. When users stake their cryptocurrency, they lock a set amount of their crypto funds for a certain period to help maintain operations on a particular proof-of-stake blockchain system.
A [proof-of-stake](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/proof-of-stake/>) mechanism is a method for some cryptos to verify transactions and consensus on their blockchain networks. With this method, users are given an incentive of rewards when they stake their coins.
### What cryptos can I stake?
According to Staking Rewards, more than $132 billion are locked up in supporting proof of stake. The cryptocurrencies with the highest staking market cap include ETH, SOL and ADA, in which the typical annual yield is around 4% to 5%.
While there are many cryptos available that are yield-bearing, the most common cryptocurrencies that traders stake for passive income are:
**•** Algorand
**•** Ethereum 2.0
**•** Chainlink (LINK)
**•** Polkadot (DOT)
**•** Cardano
Note rewards on the Ethereum network are typically locked up until the [Ethereum 2.0](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-staking-platforms/<https:/www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ethereum-2-merge/>) network is complete. Also of note, more than 10% of Ethereum is staked. Depending on the platform, traders can also stake stablecoins like USD Coin, Dai (DAI) and Tether.
### How does staking work? 
There are a vast number of cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges that allow staking, and even some crypto wallets support crypto staking, too.
While Forbes Advisors ranked Gemini, KuCoin, Kraken, Coinbase and Binance.US as the Best Crypto Exchanges for Staking and Rewards, other crypto exchanges offer staking and rewards for crypto holdings. Bitstamp and eToro are a few examples.
### Is staking risky?
Staking requires a “vesting,” or lock-up, period, where users can transfer or use their tokens. Users need to research the crypto they’re staking since they will not be able to conduct transactions with their token(s) for some time.
Cryptocurrency exchanges typically require a minimum lock-up period when you stake your crypto. And if a particular crypto is volatile, your tokens might be locked up (for staking), leaving you unable to sell.
### Are my staking rewards taxable income? 
There is no definitive IRS guidance on income taxation from crypto staking. In 2014, the IRS issued a notice that cryptocurrency is to be treated as property for federal income tax. But there is no guidance related to tax treatment for staking rewards.
That said, exchanges like Coinbase will issue users a 1099-MISC form if their crypto earnings from staking exceed $600. Other exchanges that send form 1099-MISC include Bitstamp, Binance.US, Gemini and Crypto.com, to name a few.
