Cryptocurrency has evolved from an obscure digital experiment into a major asset class with a combined market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion.1 As these digital currencies have entered the mainstream, more investors are exploring ways to generate income through this asset class. 
From casual investors looking to diversify their portfolios to dedicated traders seeking new prospects, this guide provides the knowledge needed to navigate the [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp>) market's income potential and pitfalls. 
### Key Takeaways
  * Cryptocurrency offers multiple ways to earn money, including trading, dividends, and running master nodes.
  * The market’s volatility presents both opportunities and significant risks.
  * Thorough research and strategic planning are essential to avoid common investment pitfalls.
  * Understanding the tax implications is crucial for anyone earning through cryptocurrency.


##  Understanding Cryptocurrency 
Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual tokens that use cryptography for security. They operate on decentralized networks based on [blockchain](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp>) technology. Their decentralized, peer-to-peer nature means that cryptocurrencies function without intermediaries like banks or government institutions. 
Since [Bitcoin's](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp>) launch in 2009, the space has evolved dramatically, from Ethereum's introduction of [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp>) to the emergence of thousands of specialized tokens serving unique and varied purposes. This expansion has created a rich landscape of digital assets with different value propositions and use cases. 
The investment landscape has also grown. Beyond price appreciation, today's token holders can earn passive income through staking, generate yields through decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835>)) protocols, and even earn transaction fees by providing liquidity to exchanges. 
###  Popular Cryptocurrencies 
  * **Bitcoin (BTC)** : The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is often considered "digital gold. Its dominance and network security make it the benchmark for the entire cryptocurrency market.
  * **Ethereum (ETH)** : The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, known for its smart contract capabilities. [Ethereum](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp>) hosts thousands of decentralized applications ([dApps](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp>)).
  * **Tether (USDT)** : The largest and most active [stablecoin](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp>), USDT is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a one-to-one ratio. USDT serves as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and crypto markets.
  * **Solana (SOL)** : Known for its high-speed transactions and low fees, Solana has emerged as a favored platform for meme coins and [NFTs](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211>).
  * **Ripple (XRP)** : Developed by Ripple Labs, [XRP](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/what-is-xrp-6362550>) is designed for efficient international money transfers and cross-border settlements.
  * **Dogecoin (DOGE)** : What began as a satirical commentary of the early crypto space, [DOGE](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dogecoin.asp>) has gained a wide following among speculators, though its infinite supply and meme-like nature [raises questions](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/is-doge-a-scam-security-or-a-commodity-8745922>) about its long-term value.
  * **Other notable cryptocurrencies** : Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Stellar/Lumen (XLM).


##  Ways To Earn Money with Cryptocurrency 
###  Buying and Holding 
The simplest approach is a basic buy-and-hold strategy, also known as "[HODLing](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp>)" in crypto parlance. 
HODLing often involves buying market dips and holding firm through volatility.2
###  Cryptocurrency Trading 
Active trading requires more skill, strategy, and time. Traders can pursue various strategies, from day trading based on technical analysis to longer-term position trading focused on more fundamental factors. 
Established exchanges like [Binance and Coinbase](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/binance-vs-coinbase-5120852>) offer easy buying and selling and advanced tools and are regulated (requiring AML/[KYC verification](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp>)), while [decentralized exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralizedmarket.asp>) (DEX) such as [Uniswap](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/uniswap-uni-definition-5217463>) provide greater privacy and access to newer tokens but fewer user protections. 
[Arbitrageurs](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrageur.asp>) try to capitalize on price discrepancies across exchanges, though success requires split-second execution and sophisticated tools to spot prospects. Transfer delays and fees can quickly erode profits. 
Since 2024, traders have had access to [spot Bitcoin ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-8358373>) and [spot Ether ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/understanding-spot-ethereum-etfs-8622726>), which trade via regular brokerage accounts.
###  Lending and Borrowing 
Lenders earn yields that often exceed traditional savings rates, while borrowers gain access to capital for leveraged trading without triggering taxable events or giving up their long-term crypto positions. 
Centralized services like [BlockFi](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/blockfi-wins-bankruptcy-court-approval-to-auction-mining-assets-7100844>) offer fixed rates and institutional security, while decentralized protocols such as [Aave](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/what-is-aave-6823617>) use smart contracts to automate lending with algorithmically set interest rates. 
###  Mining 
[Mining](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp>) remains a significant way to earn [proof-of-work](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp>) crypto tokens, despite increased competition and the vast amounts of energy often required. Today, crypto mining is an industrial-scale operation requiring [specialized hardware](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asic.asp>) and access to low-cost electricity.3 Many miners join [mining pools](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/how-do-mining-pools-work/>), combining computational power with others to earn more consistent, though smaller, rewards. 
###  Staking 
"[Staking](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/how-to-stake-ethereum-7482623>)" locks up tokens to help maintain the security and operations of a proof-of-stake blockchain network, earning regular rewards in return. 
[Direct staking](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/how-to-stake-solana-7378275>) involves running validator nodes and offering the highest rewards, but it requires technical expertise and significant upfront capital. 
Delegated staking through pooled validators provides a more accessible alternative, while liquid staking protocols like Lido have eliminated lockup periods by issuing tradable tokens representing staked assets. 
Staking rates vary by blockchain and period. As of Q1 2025, ETH staking earned about 3.2% annual percentage yield (APY), while SOL staking earned about 7.1% APY.4
###  Running a Master Node 
Beyond just staking, "[master nodes](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/m/master-node-cryptocurrency.asp>)" offer tech-savvy holders a way to earn passive income by essentially becoming a backbone operator of certain blockchain networks. Master node operators lock up a significant amount of cryptocurrency (say, 1,000 coins) while running powerful servers to help process transactions. In return, they receive regular rewards from the network 
[DASH](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dash-cryptocurrency/>) popularized this model, while newer networks offer tiered entry points requiring different collateral amounts. 
###  Yield Farming 
"[Yield farming](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/what-is-yield-farming-7098519>)" allows crypto holders to earn excess returns by providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges and lending protocols, though this also comes with significant risk. 
For instance, someone may deposit equal amounts of ETH and USDT into a liquidity pool on Uniswap or [Sushiswap](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/sushi-token-5248641>), earning a portion of the trading fees generated when other users swap these tokens. They might then stake their liquidity-provider tokens on another platform which becomes loaned capital that generates more yield through protocol rewards. 
Advanced strategies may employ leverage (borrowing) to boost returns, but this requires careful risk management and a solid understanding of the protocol mechanics involved. 
##  Tax Implications for Cryptocurrency Earnings 
[Cryptocurrency taxation](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/tech/how-prepare-bitcoin-tax-filing/>) is complex and evolving. In most jurisdictions, including the U.S., cryptocurrency is treated as property for tax purposes, which means every trade, conversion, or sale potentially triggers a taxable event.5 [Capital gains taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp>) apply when selling or trading cryptocurrencies held as investments. 
Mining income may be considered self-employment income, while staking and liquidity rewards are typically treated as ordinary income at their fair market value when received. Interest earned through lending platforms must be reported as ordinary income, just like traditional bank interest.6
Some activities, like swapping tokens or harvesting yield farming rewards, could create taxable events even when no fiat currency is received.7
##  Risks and Considerations 
The cryptocurrency market presents significant risks that investors must carefully evaluate, with fraud being a particularly serious concern. Losses from crypto-related fraud totaled more than $5.6 billion in 2023.89
Common fraud schemes include the following: 
  * "Rug pulls" where developers abandon projects after collecting investor funds
  * Fake cryptocurrency exchanges that disappear with deposited money
  * Phishing scams targeting crypto wallet passwords and security keys
  * Social media impersonators promising guaranteed returns
  * Pump-and-dump schemes where groups artificially inflate prices


Beyond fraud, market volatility in crypto far exceeds traditional assets. Even Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has had 70% price drops within months.10
Regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of risk. Government policies on cryptocurrency can change suddenly, potentially affecting asset values or even making certain cryptocurrencies illegal in some jurisdictions. China's 2021 crypto ban, for instance, caused a market-wide sell-off. 
Security vulnerabilities also pose significant threats. While blockchain technology itself is secure, the infrastructure around it—exchanges, wallets, and smart contracts—can be hacked. 
###  Common Mistakes to Avoid 
  * **Overinvestment** : Risking more than you can afford to lose or taking loans to invest in cryptocurrency without understanding the extreme downside risk.
  * **FOMO trading** : Buying at market peaks or rushing into trending coins without proper research, often followed by panic selling during downturns.
  * **Bad security practices** : Using weak passwords, keeping large amounts on exchanges, or failing to enable two-factor authentication.
  * **Ignoring the tax implications** : Failing to keep proper records of trades and earnings, leading to tax compliance issues.
  * **Misunderstanding DeFi** : Diving into complex yield farming or leveraged trading without grasping concepts like impermanent loss or liquidation risks.
  * **Lack of[diversification](https://www.investopedia.com/<https:/www.investopedia.com/investing/importance-diversification/>)**: Concentrating investments in a single cryptocurrency or token instead of spreading risk across different assets.


##  The Bottom Line 
Cryptocurrency offers opportunities for generating value, from HODLing and passive investment strategies to active trading and network participation. Success requires a thorough understanding of the technology and market dynamics, careful risk management, and a strategic approach to choosing which earning methods to pursue. 
While the potential for significant returns exists, it remains essential to approach cryptocurrency investment with significant caution. Consider consulting with knowledgeable financial professionals for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

### Learn-to-Earn Courses
The Learn-to-Earn (L2E) model **rewards users with cryptocurrency or**[**non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/what-is-nft>) for completing educational courses, quizzes, or blockchain-related content.

Aside from BitDegree, several exchanges also reward users for completing educational content. One of the most well-known platforms is [**Binance Academy**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/binance-academy>), which offers free courses on blockchain and cryptocurrency, as well as guides on navigating the exchange itself. Coinbase users can also access [**Coinbase Earn**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/coinbase-earn-crypto>), which typically offers rewards in tokens such as [**Stellar (XLM)**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-stellar-xlm>), [**Compound (COMP)**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-compound-comp>), **or** [**USD Coin (USDC)**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-usd-coin-usdc>).
#### Pros of Learn-to-Earn Courses
Let's explore the positive sides of "learn-to-earn" courses that can be your way to make passive income with crypto:
  * **Monetizes learning**. Users can earn cryptocurrency while gaining valuable knowledge about the industry.
  * **No upfront cost**. Many platforms offer free access to educational content, removing financial barriers.
  * **On-chain certificates**. NFT-based certifications provide verifiable proof of completion, beneficial for career opportunities.


Overall, if you're curious about crypto and looking for an engaging way to learn and earn, L2E platforms can be a good starting point.
#### Cons of Learn-to-Earn Courses
While L2E platforms offer a simple way to gain crypto knowledge and potentially earn rewards, it's important to understand the limitations associated with this model.
  * **Limited earnings**. Rewards may be small unless users consistently complete multiple courses.
  * **Platform-specific rewards**. Some platforms distribute rewards in native tokens, which may need to be converted for liquidity.
  * **Not entirely passive**. Unlike staking or lending, users must actively engage in learning to earn rewards.


If your primary goal is substantial payments, other methods on how to make passive income with crypto may be more suitable.
### Crypto Savings Account
Crypto savings accounts offer an easy way to earn passive income by depositing digital assets into interest-bearing accounts. These accounts **function similarly to traditional bank savings accounts** but often provide much higher interest rates. Instead of earning interest from a bank, depositors earn crypto rewards!
So, how do crypto savings accounts work? Typically, when you deposit funds into a crypto savings account, the platform lends your assets to borrowers, institutions, or [**liquidity pools**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/learn/what-is-liquidity-pool-in-crypto>). In return, you earn interest payments, which can be compounded over time.
![How to make passive income with crypto: a pen, calculator, and statistics with numbers.](https://assets.bitdegree.org/images/how-to-make-passive-income-with-crypto-statistics.jpg)
**The amount of interest payments depends on several factors** , including the platform's interest rates, the type of cryptocurrency you deposit, and the duration of your deposit.
One of the popular platforms offering crypto savings accounts is [**Binance**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/binance>). Through its Simple Earn program, it lets you choose from various cryptocurrencies, **including** [**BTC**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-bitcoin-btc>), [**ETH**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-ethereum-eth>), **and**[**BNB**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-binance-coin-bnb>), and subscribe to:
  * **Flexible Products**. It lets users start earning rewards every minute.
  * **Locked Products**. This offers different locked terms, and rewards are distributed on a daily basis.


Alternatively, there's [**KuCoin**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/kucoin>), which offers flexible deposits and withdrawals for many cryptocurrencies with an estimated [**annual percentage rate (APR)**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/learn/crypto-terms/what-is-annual-percentage-rate-apr>)**of up to 9%**. Your return depends on the cryptocurrency you choose and the savings product you select, such as "Flexible Savings" or "Limited-Time Events".
After subscribing to a savings product, you can enable **Auto Subscribe**. With this feature activated, your designated cryptocurrency balance from your trading or funding account is automatically transferred to Savings daily at 1:00 AM (UTC).
#### Pros of Crypto Savings Accounts
Crypto savings accounts offer several attractive benefits, primarily centered around the convenient access to generating crypto passive income:
  * **High interest rates compared to banks**. Crypto savings accounts often offer higher interest rates than traditional banks, with 0.5% or less.
  * **Passive and simple**. Once funds are deposited, interest accumulates without requiring active management or engaging in risky trading or price speculation.
  * **Diversification**. Many exchanges offer a wide selection of cryptocurrencies, so you can diversify your income streams within the same platform and strategy.


In summary, crypto savings accounts are attractive due to their ease of use and higher interest rates. Those are specifically important for beginners learning how to make passive income with crypto.
#### Cons of Crypto Savings Accounts
Despite the advantages, it's crucial to acknowledge the risks associated with crypto savings accounts, including:
  * **Lower interest rates**. Compared to some other strategies like staking or lending, crypto savings accounts offer lower returns.
  * **Not FDIC-insured**. If you prioritize deposit insurance like traditional banks, crypto savings platforms may not be an option since these don't offer government-backed protection.


While the convenience and passive income potential are attractive, the lower returns compared to other strategies and the lack of deposit insurance should be key factors in your decision-making process.
### Staking
The concept of [**staking**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/learn/crypto-terms/what-is-staking>) may sound similar to crypto savings accounts – **"depositing" some of your cryptocurrency to get rewards in return**. However, instead of simply waiting for the interests, staking is "more active" since you participate in running a cryptocurrency network that uses [**Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/learn/crypto-terms/what-is-proof-of-stake-pos>). This locked-up crypto helps the network confirm transactions and stay secure. Think of it like guaranteeing the network's smooth operation.
When you stake, you become a validator (or you can delegate your stake to someone who is). Validators are like the bookkeepers of the blockchain, ensuring everything is accurate. **For your help in keeping the network running, you earn rewards** , usually in the form of more of that cryptocurrency or a share of the transaction fees.
![How to make passive income with crypto: gold Ethereum coin with stacks of coins in the background.](https://assets.bitdegree.org/images/how-to-make-passive-income-with-crypto-staking-eth.jpg)
To get started with staking, **you need a staking-compatible wallet or an exchange** that offers such services. Before you decide on certain options, consider:
  * The potential annual yield (APY);
  * Lock-up period;
  * Minimum staking amount.


These factors significantly impact your staking experience and potential returns. For example, **high APYs often mean longer lock-ups** and/or higher minimums. For example, a 10% APY might require a 90-day lock-up and a 1000-token minimum, while a 5% APY could have no lock-up or minimum.
Generally, lock-ups allow platforms to use staked coins for longer periods, potentially generating more rewards, hence the higher APY. Shorter or no lock-ups offer more flexibility but usually come with lower APYs. Choose the option that best balances potential returns with your need for access to your funds.
My suggestion is to start with popular crypto wallets like [**Ledger Flex**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/ledger-flex>)**and**[**Trezor Safe 5**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/trezor-safe-5>) or crypto exchanges like [**Bybit**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/bybit>), [**Binance**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/binance>), **and**[**Coinbase**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/coinbase>).

#### Pros of Staking
Here are some positive points on why you should choose staking as a way to make passive income with crypto:
  * **Accessibility**. Unlike mining, staking doesn’t require expensive hardware or technical expertise.
  * **"Predictable" earnings**. Staking rewards are relatively stable and often depend on the total amount staked and the lock-up period.
  * **Compounding potential**. Reinvesting your staking rewards can exponentially grow your holdings over time, especially if the staked asset appreciates in value.


If you're looking for a reliable way to build your crypto portfolio, staking's accessibility and compounding potential make it a compelling choice.
#### Cons of Staking
While staking offers enticing opportunities for passive income, it's essential to understand the potential drawbacks, such as:
  * **Capital requirement**. The higher the stake, the higher the rewards. Some networks require a substantial initial investment to generate significant passive income.
  * **Regulatory risks**. Some governments are imposing restrictions on staking services, which can affect centralized platforms offering staking rewards.


Understanding potential downsides when pursuing staking as a passive income strategy helps you mitigate risks. You may adjust your staking strategy or choose alternatives that suit your budget or investment goals.
### Play-to-Earn Games
[**Play-to-Earn (P2E)**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/learn/crypto-terms/what-is-play-to-earn-play2earn>) games allow users to earn cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens by engaging in gameplay. [**The games create a win-win situation**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.mdpi.com/0718-1876/19/1/26>)[[1]](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<#references>) – companies generate revenue, while players have the opportunity to earn income by trading the digital items they acquire in the game.
As these blockchain-based games **offer financial incentives** , users can monetize their time and skills. Hence, it's not practically a "passive" way to make money from crypto, but it offers an interesting alternative income stream that rewards players for their effort and engagement.
![How to make passive income with crypto: a professional gamer playing a game on his PC.](https://assets.bitdegree.org/images/how-to-make-passive-income-with-crypto-professional-gamer.jpg)
Unlike traditional gaming, where in-game assets have no real-world value outside the platform, Play-to-Earn games **allow users to own, trade, and sell** their digital items for cryptocurrency. Generally, the process of how to earn passive income with crypto using P2E games looks like this:
  * **Players engage in gameplay and earn rewards** in the form of in-game tokens or NFTs. Some games distribute tokens based on activity levels, skill, or rankings in competitive matches.
  * Some games have **daily, weekly, or seasonal challenges** that boost earnings.
  * They can **sell the earned tokens and NFTs** on crypto marketplaces or use those within the game to improve performance. Alternatively, players convert their earnings to fiat through exchanges, increasing their real-world value.


The process seems simple and rewarding, right? Especially if you're a gamer — earning money while doing what you love sounds almost too good to be true. However, it's important to note that P2E games fall into two main categories: **free-to-play (F2P) models** , which require no upfront investment, and **pay-to-play (P2P) models** , where players must invest in NFTs to purchase characters or access premium features.
Therefore, when you research the best crypto games for you, make sure to consider factors like initial investment, earning potential, and long-term sustainability. Also, I suggest that you look for games that offer multiple earning opportunities, so you can maximize your rewards and diversify your income streams.
Some P2E games allow users to stake their in-game tokens to earn passive income while actively shaping the game's ecosystem.
For instance, in [**Axie Infinity**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/axie-infinity-review>), players can stake Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) to receive rewards and gain governance rights, allowing them to influence key decisions about the game's future. Similarly, in [**Alien Worlds**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto-tracker/top-bsc-dapps/alien-worlds>), staking Trilium (TLM) enables players to participate in the governance of planets within the game while also earning additional rewards.
📚 **Read More** : [**Best NFT Games**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/best-nft-games>)
#### Pros of Play-to-Earn Games
Many people may want to start P2E games because of these reasons:
  * **Monetization of gameplay**. Players can earn real-world value from their gaming time through crypto rewards, NFTs, and in-game assets.
  * **Community-driven growth**. Strong player communities can increase the value of digital assets.
  * **Potential for passive income**. Some games allow staking of tokens or renting out NFTs for passive earnings.


While P2E games can be an exciting start to earning passive income with crypto, those are not without risks. Before diving in, you should weigh the potential downsides.
#### Cons of Play-to-Earn Games
Here are two considerations if you plan to choose play-to-earn games to build your crypto passive income journey:
  * **High initial investment**. Some games require purchasing NFTs or tokens to start earning, which can be expensive.
  * **Play-to-earn feels like "work"**. Grinding for rewards can feel less enjoyable compared to traditional gaming.


P2E games offer thrilling opportunities, but players should approach them with caution and strategy. Research game tokenomics, community support, and sustainability models to help mitigate risks and ensure a more rewarding experience.

### Lending
Crypto lending lets users **lend crypto for interest or use it as loan collateral**. It's popular due to accessibility **(no credit checks)** , potential high returns, and quick liquidity. Two main participants are lenders (who deposit crypto to earn interest) and borrowers (_who secure loans with crypto collateral_). As a way to earn passive income with crypto, you can be a lender and deposit your assets.
These platforms pool the deposited assets and lend them out to borrowers. In return for lending your crypto, you receive interest payments. **The interest rate you earn varies** depending on the platform, the type of cryptocurrency you lend, and the loan terms.
For example, [**Binance Loan**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/binance>) offers fixed-term lending options, such as 30-day and 180-day periods, with fixed interest rates (e.g., between 3% and 4.36% at the time of writing for USDT and USDC) with no fees. As a supplier, you only need to select an order from the Supply Market and confirm the order details to send your assets to Binance.
![How to make passive income with crypto: Binance Loan feature.](https://assets.bitdegree.org/images/how-to-make-passive-income-with-crypto-binance-loan.jpg)
Once the order expires, Binance sends your supplied assets with the return interest accumulated to your spot wallet.
If you're looking for a more flexible option, [**Bybit**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/bybit>) can be your answer. With this platform, you can **redeem whenever the redemption window is available**. Your potential return when lending crypto through a pool is automatically calculated based on how much of the pool is currently loaned out (the Loan-to-Pool ratio) and which cryptocurrency you've lent.
Bybit adjusts the APR and interest you earn every hour to reflect current market conditions and the actual interest accrued on the borrowed funds. Besides the flexibility, the platform offers a wide selection of cryptocurrencies to lend, **including** [**BTC**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-bitcoin-btc>), [**ETH**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-ethereum-eth>), [**XRP**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-ripple-xrp>), and [**SOL**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-solana-sol>). Bybit also plans to add more options in the future.
Since each lending platform has unique offerings, it's crucial to carefully research and compare them before committing your crypto. Consider factors like:
  * Interest rates;
  * Loan terms (fixed VS flexible);
  * Supported cryptocurrencies;
  * Platform security and reputation;
  * Any associated fees.


I suggest starting with the [**best lending platforms,**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/crypto-lending-platform>) like Bybit and Binance, because these have generally established a positive track record within the crypto community and implemented security measures.
#### Pros of Lending
Crypto lending has several potential advantages for those looking to generate returns on their digital assets, such as:
  * **Consistent interest earnings**. Lenders earn fixed or variable interest rates on their deposits, often higher than traditional savings accounts.
  * **No need to sell crypto**. Instead of selling assets to profit, lenders can earn passive income while holding their coins.
  * **Accessibility**. Crypto lending platforms often have less stringent requirements than traditional financial institutions, so you can access the services more easily.


Risks always exist when we deal with financial instruments, but these advantages can make crypto lending an attractive option for many crypto holders.
#### Cons of Lending
Despite the benefits, I think you should know some of the risks before participating:
  * **Platform risk**. Crypto lending platforms are not immune to hacks, scams, or even collapse. If the platform you use experiences issues, you could lose some or all of your funds.
  * **Liquidity risk**. While less common, there can be times when a platform limits withdrawals or lending due to market conditions.
  * **Tax implications**. The interest you earn from lending crypto is typically taxable, and the tax rules can be complex.


It's crucial to weigh these risks against the potential rewards and only lend what you can afford to lose.
### Crypto Mining
[**Crypto mining**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/how-to-mine-cryptocurrency>) is one of the oldest and most well-known ways to earn passive income with cryptocurrency. It operates under **a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism** , where miners' hardware solves complex mathematical equations to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the equation **receives a block reward** , along with transaction fees from the validated transactions.
This process ensures decentralization, security, and integrity within the blockchain network. Although mining is **often associated with Bitcoin** , various other cryptocurrencies, **such as** [**Litecoin (LTC)**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-litecoin-ltc>) **and** [**Monero (XMR)**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/buy-monero-xmr>), also rely on mining for network security. In the table below, I compare the primary mining methods, highlighting their hardware requirements, efficiency, cost, flexibility, and key features.
Mining Method| Hardware Used| Efficiency| Flexibility| Cost| Key takeaway  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
**ASIC Mining**|  Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)| Highest| Low (designed for specific coins)| High| Very efficient but expensive  
**GPU Mining**|  Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)| Medium| Medium (can mine various coins)| Medium| More flexible than ASICs, less efficient  
**CPU Mining**|  Central Processing Units (CPUs)| Low| High (can mine various coins)| Low (uses existing hardware)| Least efficient but most accessible  
**Cloud Mining**|  Rented mining power from data centers| Variable| High (no hardware management)| Variable (rental fees)| Convenient, but potential risks (scams, fees)  
**Mining Pools**|  Combined computational power| Variable| Variable| Shared cost| Combines resources for better rewards, distributed earnings  
 _Table: Types of mining_
Overall, choosing the right mining method depends on your individual circumstances, including your budget, technical expertise, and risk tolerance.
#### Pros of Mining
Cryptocurrency mining, while complex, offers several potential benefits to those who engage in it, such as:
  * **Potential for maximum profit**. Once mining equipment is set up, it can generate rewards, sometimes with minimal effort. Additionally, mining rewards can be worth significantly more than the operational costs in a bull market.
  * **Support for blockchain networks**. Being miners means you contribute to the security of crypto ecosystems.
  * **Technological engagement**. Mining can be a rewarding experience for those interested in technology and cryptography.


In essence, cryptocurrency mining presents a compelling proposition for those seeking potential profit, a direct role in supporting the networks, and a deep dive into blockchain technology.
#### Cons of Mining
Although mining can bring a lot of money, there are several risks that can make it difficult to be profitable:
  * **High initial costs**. ASIC and GPU miners, specifically, require a significant upfront investment.
  * **Energy-intensive**. Mining consumes a large amount of electricity, leading to high operational costs and [**contributing to greenhouse gas emissions**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/14/4254>),[[2]](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<#references>) particularly when fossil fuels are the primary energy source.
  * **Hardware maintenance**. Mining rigs need regular upkeep, cooling, and repairs to keep them functional.


Carefully consider these drawbacks before making any decisions, especially if you prioritize environmental sustainability and ethical energy consumption.

Affiliate programs work by providing users with a unique referral link that they can share with others. When someone signs up and trades, stakes, or invests using that link, the referrer earns a commission, cashback, or a percentage of the platform’s fees.
![How to make passive income with crypto: the Binance Referral program.](https://assets.bitdegree.org/images/how-to-make-passive-income-with-crypto-binance-referral-program.jpg)
Leading crypto exchanges and wallets provide affiliate programs with varying rewards. For instance, [**Binance**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/binance>) provides a $100 trading fee rebate for successful referrals. Additionally, those preferring cryptocurrency payouts can choose [**Kraken**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/kraken>) rewards in USDC or BTC or invite friends to buy Ledger wallets, such as [**Ledger Flex**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/ledger-flex>)**or**[**Ledger Stax**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/crypto/goon/ledger-stax>), and earn $20 in Bitcoin for every purchase.
Additionally, as noted previously, [**BitDegree**](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/<https:/www.bitdegree.org/friends>) also has a referral program that can help you receive extra Bits for the Season 7 Airdrop. Not only will you get rewarded for each friend you invite, but also for their referrals as well.
In addition to the abundance of options, joining affiliate programs to make passive income with crypto is simple. Users typically only need to sign up (with potential KYC verification) and share their unique referral link.

#### Pros of Affiliate Programs
Joining affiliate programs presents an opportunity to generate income passively. Here's why this option may be the best "passive income with crypto" strategy for you:
  * **No investment is required**. Unlike staking or yield farming, affiliate programs don’t require you to deposit money.
  * **Passive earnings**. Once set up, referrals can generate long-term commissions with little ongoing effort.
  * **Multiple platforms to choose from**. Many crypto exchanges, wallets, and DeFi services offer competitive affiliate programs. You can also join some of them at the same time!


With their low barrier to entry and potential for ongoing earnings, crypto affiliate programs can be a good starting point for anyone searching for ways how to make passive income with crypto.
#### Cons of Affiliate Programs
Although affiliate programs sound like an irresistible opportunity for passive income in the crypto world, it's important to understand that they aren't entirely hands-off. Here are several key aspects you need to consider:
  * **Requires marketing effort**. To be successful, you need to actively promote your links that may involve content creation or audience-building strategies.
  * **Earnings depend on referrals’ activity**. If your referrals don’t trade or invest, you don't earn commissions.


In essence, crypto affiliate programs are not a 'get-rich-quick' scheme. Building a successful affiliate income stream needs dedication and strategic marketing.

## What Are the Key Considerations When Making Passive Income With Crypto?
Earning passive income with crypto can be rewarding, but it comes with risks and factors to consider. Here are the key aspects to evaluate before choosing a method for how to make passive income with crypto:
  * **Risk VS reward**. I've outlined the pros and cons of each passive income method. Every option carries certain downsides, so choose an approach where you're comfortable with the associated risks.
  * **Platform credibility**. Ensure the platform you use is reputable and secure. Check for regulatory compliance, user reviews, and security measures.
  * **Fees and costs**. Some passive income methods may involve fees, such as transaction and withdrawal fees. So, calculate the total cost of participation, including any potential fees, to accurately assess the profitability of each method.


With the pros and cons of every approach, I suggest that you consider diversifying your passive income strategies across multiple methods to mitigate risk and maximize potential returns. Doing this helps create a more resilient and balanced portfolio.

This article explores popular methods for earning passive crypto income, their risks and rewards, and tips to maximize earnings. Whether you're a seasoned investor or a crypto-curious beginner, you’ll find actionable insights to start your journey.
## **Can You Earn Passive Income With Cryptocurrency?**
Earning passive income with cryptocurrency is possible and increasingly popular. Unlike traditional savings, crypto income strategies often provide higher returns by utilizing blockchain’s decentralized infrastructure. Methods like staking and lending allow users to earn rewards while supporting network operations or facilitating loans.
The appeal lies in diversifying income streams and taking advantage of the booming crypto ecosystem. With proper knowledge, passive crypto income can become a viable alternative for financial growth. However, risks like market volatility and platform reliability must be carefully considered before diving in.
## **Popular Methods For Earning Passive Income With Crypto**
Explore these proven strategies to earn passive crypto income and understand their benefits and risks.
### **Staking**
Staking involves locking your cryptocurrency in a blockchain network to support transaction validation and earn rewards. It’s common in [Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-to-earn-passive-income-cryptocurrency/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp> "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp") networks like Ethereum 2.0, Cardano and Polkadot.

Popular platforms like Binance, Kraken and Coinbase simplify staking, promising consistent returns. Benefits include low barriers to entry and network security contribution. However, risks include volatility and potential loss if networks fail or are attacked. Staking rewards typically range from 5-20% annually depending on the coin and platform.
### **Yield Farming**
Yield farming, or liquidity mining, involves providing liquidity to [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-to-earn-passive-income-cryptocurrency/<https:/www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/what-is-defi/> "https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/what-is-defi/") platforms exchange for rewards. Users deposit crypto into liquidity pools, earning transaction fees or additional tokens.
While yield farming generally offers higher returns than staking, risks are higher. Smart contract vulnerabilities, [impermanent loss](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-to-earn-passive-income-cryptocurrency/<https:/academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained> "https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained"), and volatile token values can negatively impact gains. Research platforms carefully and use reliable tools like MetaMask or Ledger wallets for security.
### **Lending**
Crypto lending platforms decentralized protocols allow users to earn interest by lending crypto to borrowers. These platforms match lenders with borrowers, paying interest on deposits.
Returns often range between 5-15%, making lending an attractive option. Risks include platform insolvency, fluctuating collateral values and regulatory uncertainty. Evaluate lending terms and ensure the platform complies with robust security and compliance standards.
### **Interest Through Crypto Savings Accounts**
[Crypto savings accounts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-to-earn-passive-income-cryptocurrency/<https:/www.youhodler.com/blog/how-to-choose-crypto-saving-account> "https://www.youhodler.com/blog/how-to-choose-crypto-saving-account") function like traditional accounts but with higher yields. These accounts often provide flexibility, letting users withdraw at any time, though fixed-term options may offer higher returns. Risks include platform security and interest rates affected by crypto market dynamics.
### **Crypto Mining**
[Mining involves](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-to-earn-passive-income-cryptocurrency/<https:/www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-to-mine-bitcoin/> "https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-to-mine-bitcoin/") using computational power to validate blockchain transactions, earning crypto rewards. Bitcoin and Ethereum mining are popular, though hardware costs and energy consumption make entry expensive.
New miners can explore cloud mining or altcoin mining for lower barriers. While profitable during bull markets, profitability depends on electricity costs, hardware efficiency and market conditions.
### **Running A Masternode**
[Masternodes are specialized nodes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-to-earn-passive-income-cryptocurrency/<https:/cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-generate-passive-crypto-income-with-masternodes> "https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-generate-passive-crypto-income-with-masternodes") requiring significant crypto collateral to operate. They help manage blockchain governance and offer consistent rewards. While rewards can be substantial, masternodes require technical expertise and high initial investment. Market volatility and network changes may impact returns.
## **Tips For Maximizing Your Passive Earnings**
### **Diversify Your Strategies**
Diversification reduces risk by spreading investments across multiple crypto income methods. For example, combine staking with lending or yield farming to balance potential rewards and risks. This approach ensures that no single failure significantly impacts your portfolio.
### **Research Before Investing Into A Method**
Understanding the platform, network, and risks is crucial. Use reputable sources to evaluate opportunities, including technical documentation and user reviews. Verify platform security, compliance and historical performance before committing funds.
### **Start Small And Scale Gradually**
Begin with small investments to minimize risks and learn from experience. As you gain confidence and expertise, scale your investments for larger returns. This cautious approach protects your capital while building knowledge.
### **Watch Out For Scams**
The rapid growth of cryptocurrency has brought incredible opportunities—but also countless scams. The decentralized and pseudonymous nature of crypto makes it a prime target for fraudsters. By understanding the risks and knowing the red flags, you can protect yourself and your investments.
Common scams include pump-and-dump schemes, where bad actors inflate a coin’s value to attract buyers before selling off their holdings, causing the price to crash. Phishing attacks are another common tactic, where fake emails or websites are designed to steal your credentials or wallet keys. Imposter giveaways promising “free crypto” in exchange for deposits are also widespread—real giveaways never require you to send money first.
To protect yourself, be cautious of promises of guaranteed returns or pressure to act quickly. Always verify platforms, emails and offers through official sources. Use secure wallets, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and never share your private keys or recovery phrases.
If you fall victim to a scam, report it to the relevant platform and authorities immediately. While recovering lost funds can be difficult, staying informed and vigilant can help you avoid future traps. Crypto offers great potential, but your best defense is knowledge and caution.
## **Bottom Line**
Earning passive income with cryptocurrency is an accessible way to grow wealth while supporting blockchain innovation. From staking to running masternodes, there are methods for every skill level and risk tolerance. Diversify strategies, research thoroughly and start small to navigate the crypto ecosystem confidently. With patience and planning, you can maximize passive crypto earnings.

![The Best Ways to Earn Passive Income Through Cryptocurrency](https://nftevening.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-7.jpg)
Passive income has always been a financial goal for many people. The idea of earning money without having to actively work for it every single day is not just appealing—it’s smart. Passive income allows you to grow your wealth over time while giving you the freedom to focus on other important areas of your life. Whether spending more time with family, pursuing hobbies, or planning for the future, having a steady stream of income in the background offers security and peace of mind. It’s like planting a tree that keeps growing and bearing fruit year after year.
Cryptocurrency has made the search for passive income even more exciting. With the rapid adoption of digital assets and the growing size of the crypto market, new ways to earn without constant effort are opening up. The beauty of crypto-based passive income is its flexibility. Unlike traditional investments that might take years to show returns, many crypto strategies can start generating results fairly quickly.
## **1. Investing in Cloud Mining Platforms**
Traditional [cryptocurrency mining](https://nftevening.com/the-best-ways-to-earn-passive-income-through-cryptocurrency/<https:/ztmining.com?sjy=nfteve>) often demands significant capital for hardware and incurs substantial electricity costs. Cloud mining presents an alternative by enabling users to lease mining power from remote data centers. It eliminates the need for personal mining equipment and the associated operational challenges.

Platforms like [ZT Mining](https://nftevening.com/the-best-ways-to-earn-passive-income-through-cryptocurrency/<https:/ztmining.com?sjy=nfteve>) have gained traction by offering eco-friendly mining solutions and utilizing renewable energy sources to power their operations. Users can select from various contract durations and hash rates. However, conducting thorough research before committing funds is crucial, as the industry has witnessed instances of fraudulent schemes. Sticking to reliable platforms like [ZT Mining](https://nftevening.com/the-best-ways-to-earn-passive-income-through-cryptocurrency/<https:/ztmining.com?sjy=nfteve>) with transparent operations can mitigate potential risks.
## **2. Staking: Earning Rewards Through Participation**
Staking involves holding a specific amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network. In return, participants receive rewards, typically in the form of additional tokens. This method is prevalent in networks that utilize Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms.
For instance, Ethereum’s transition to PoS allows ETH holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards. The process often requires locking up funds for a set period, during which they contribute to network security and transaction validation. 
While staking offers a relatively stable income stream, it’s essential to be aware of potential risks, such as token value fluctuations and the possibility of penalties for network downtime.
## **3. Yield Farming: Maximizing Returns in DeFi**
Yield farming, a concept rooted in decentralized finance (DeFi), involves providing liquidity to DeFi protocols in exchange for interest or additional tokens. Participants supply their assets to liquidity pools, facilitating trading and lending activities within the ecosystem.
Top platforms automate the process, moving funds between various protocols to optimize returns. While yield farming can offer attractive yields, it comes with inherent risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities and market volatility. 
Engaging with well-audited platforms and diversifying investments can help manage these risks.
## **4. Crypto Lending: Earning Interest on Digital Assets**
Crypto lending platforms enable users to lend their digital assets to borrowers in exchange for interest payments. This process can be facilitated through centralized platforms or decentralized protocols.
The crypto lending platforms offer interest-bearing accounts where users can deposit cryptocurrencies and earn yields. The interest rates vary based on the asset and platform, with some offering higher returns for stablecoins. 
While crypto lending provides a passive income stream, it’s important to consider factors such as platform security, regulatory compliance, and the potential for borrower defaults.
## **5. Participating in Affiliate Programs: Leveraging Networks for Rewards**
Affiliate programs in crypto allow individuals to earn commissions by promoting cryptocurrency-related products or services. Participants receive unique referral links and earn rewards when new users sign up or transact through their links.
Exchanges like Binance and Coinbase offer affiliate programs with varying commission structures. This method requires minimal investment and can be particularly lucrative for individuals with a substantial online presence or network. However, success in affiliate marketing often hinges on effective promotion and the credibility of the products or services being endorsed.
## **Final Words**
The cryptocurrency realm offers diverse opportunities for [generating passive income](https://nftevening.com/the-best-ways-to-earn-passive-income-through-cryptocurrency/<https:/ztmining.com?sjy=nfteve>). Each method carries its own set of benefits and risks. Prospective investors should conduct thorough research, assess their risk tolerance, and consider diversifying their strategies to optimize returns while mitigating potential downsides.

![Crypto interest rewards for passive income](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/676f0692bb6db2151ea03379_64f8a6eec874c842da8d3fe8_Crypto-Passive-Income-v1-infographic-1.jpeg)
## Cryptocurrency interest rewards 
**Difficulty:** Easy 
Many cryptocurrency exchanges offer interest rewards on cryptocurrency. Currently, platforms like Coinbase offer rewards over 5% on USDC! 
**How to get started:**
  1. Buy USDC on a platform like [Coinbase](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/www.coinbase.com/earn>) or [Kraken](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/www.kraken.com/features/staking-coins/usdc>). 
  2. Hold your USDC on the platform — and let the rewards start pouring in! Platforms like Kraken may require you to opt-in to start earning rewards. 


**Pros**
**Easy to get started:** Earning interest rewards is low effort! All you need to do to get started is to open up an account with an exchange and deposit the relevant cryptocurrency. You’ll get started earning rewards automatically! 
**Low technical barrier:** Unlike some of the other items in this article, earning cryptocurrency interest requires a very low technical barrier to entry! 
**Easy liquidity:** Most exchanges allow you to easily withdraw your cryptocurrency — meaning that you’ll have access to your crypto when you need it! 
**Cons**
**High investment for reliable income:** To earn a reliable monthly income from interest rewards, you’ll need to have a large amount of cryptocurrency deposited in your exchange. Remember, your interest rewards are calculated based on how much crypto you deposit. 
**Bankruptcy risk:** Before you choose a cryptocurrency platform, you should do your research. In the past, cryptocurrency exchanges like BlockFi and Celsius that offered high interest rewards [went bankrupt](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/celsius-voyager-crypto-losses-tax-write-offs>). 
![Dividend earning crypto tokens passive income](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/676f0692bb6db2151ea03345_64f8a707c4ded416c8aec162_Crypto-Passive-Income-v1-infographic-4.jpeg)
## Dividend earning tokens 
**Difficulty:** Easy 
Dividend-earning tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that provides holders with a share of the project's earnings or profits. Unlike traditional stocks, where dividends are paid out in fiat currency, dividend-earning tokens give holders additional units of the same cryptocurrency. 
**How to get started**
  1. Find a cryptocurrency that offers dividends — such as [KuCoin’s KCS](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/www.kucoin.com/kcs>), [AscendEX’s ASD](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/ascendex.com/en/platform-token>), and [NEO](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/neo.org/>). 
  2. Hold the cryptocurrency and start earning rewards! 


**Pros**
**Low effort:** Since dividend earning tokens pay out dividends automatically, earning passive income is relatively low effort! 
**Compound interest:** Typically, dividend earning tokens offer compound interest — which could lead to large rewards! 
**Cons**
**Limited adoption:** Dividend earning tokens are relatively uncommon. It’s much easier to find cryptocurrencies that offer staking rewards. 
**High risk:** Many dividend earning tokens are not as established as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a result, dividend earning tokens may have a higher risk of failure. Do research before you invest! 
![Staking crypto passive income](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/676f0692bb6db2151ea03348_64f8a6ce32452784f72a6ed1_Crypto-Passive-Income-v1-infographic-3.jpeg)
## Staking 
**Difficulty:** Easy 
[Cryptocurrency staking](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/staking-taxes>) involves locking up a certain amount of a particular cryptocurrency to support the underlying blockchain network's operations. In return for staking their coins and helping to maintain the blockchain's security and consensus, participants receive staking rewards! 
**How to get started**
  1. Use MetaMask (or another wallet that offers cryptocurrency staking). 
  2. Go to the [cryptocurrency you wish to stake](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/tools/best-crypto-for-staking>), then click ‘Stake’. 
  3. Choose a staking validator, then follow the instructions to complete the process. 


Alternatively, you can use an exchange like Coinbase to stake your cryptocurrency. However, the SEC has been cracking down on staking services offered by centralized exchanges, claiming that this is an ‘[unregistered security](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/www.theverge.com/2024/3/27/24113472/sec-coinbase-crypto-lawsuit-unregistered-securities>)’. 
**Pros**
**Easy to get started:** Compared to mining, staking is generally less resource-intensive and requires minimal technical expertise. Many platforms and [wallets](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/tools/best-crypto-wallet>) support staking services! 
**Stable earnings:** Staking earnings are typically more stable and reliable than other forms of passive income! 
**Compound interest:** Staking rewards automatically compound — which can lead to a large growth in your assets over time! 
**Cons**
**Percentage of investment:** Your staking rewards are typically a percentage of the cryptocurrency you staked. This means that you’ll need a large stake to earn a reliable passive income. 
**Regulatory risk:** In recent years, the SEC has claimed that exchanges offering staking as a service should be considered an ‘unregistered security’. As a result, exchanges are not able to provide cryptocurrency staking services in some jurisdictions. 
**Liquidity:** Cryptocurrency staking sometimes requires you to ‘lock up’ your holdings for a set period of time, which means that you may run into issues if you need access to your holdings immediately! 
![Crypto lending for passive income](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/676f0692bb6db2151ea0334b_64f8a6b22f881a9f4c0e6df7_Crypto-Passive-Income-v1-infographic-2.jpeg)
## Crypto lending 
**Difficulty:** Medium
You can earn rewards by lending your crypto to businesses and traders! Lending platforms and DeFi protocols manage the process, allowing you to easily earn rewards!
**How to get started**
  1. Get a wallet — such as [MetaMask](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/metamask.io/>) — that can interact with decentralized applications. Make sure this wallet is funded with the cryptocurrency you want to lend. 
  2. Go to the [Compound Finance app](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/app.compound.finance/markets>) and click ‘Connect Wallet’. 
  3. Add the cryptocurrency you wish to supply. Then click ‘Approve & Add’. 


**Pros**
**Low barrier to entry:** Getting started with lending out your cryptocurrency through a platform is relatively easy and low effort. 
**Compound interest:** DeFi protocols like Compound offer the ability to earn compound interest on DeFi lending! 
**Cons**
**Platform risk:** It’s important to do research on your cryptocurrency loan platform before getting started. In the past, cryptocurrency loan platforms like Celsius and BlockFi have gone bankrupt — which means customers lost access to holdings. 
**Low protections:** Most crypto lending platforms are unregulated and offer limited protections to borrowers and lenders.
**Illiquid:** It’s often difficult to withdraw your holdings from a crypto lending platform. It’s likely that you’ll need to go through a long waiting period to get access to your funds.

## Play-to-earn games 
**Difficulty:** Medium
[Play-to-earn games](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/cryptocurrency-games-taxes>) like [Axie Infinity](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/axie-infinity-taxes>) allows users to earn cryptocurrency rewards while playing games! 
**How to get started:**
  1. Most play-to-earn games require you to buy NFT items to get started. For example, Axie Infinity requires you to purchase three Axies (Pokemon-like creatures) to start the game. 
  2. Once you have the items you need, download the game on your device! 
  3. Start playing the game and earning rewards! 


**Pros**
**Fun:** Play-to-earn games combine the potential for passive income with entertainment. You’ll have the opportunity to earn rewards while playing engaging video games! 
**Inclusive:** Play-to-earn games are inclusive! Earning money through play-to-earn can be a great option for investors who don’t have the technical skills necessary for methods like cryptocurrency mining. 
**Globally accessible:** Play-to-earn games are accessible all over the world! Some investors even choose to set up ‘scholarship programs’. In these programs, gamers give funds to investors in low cost-of-living countries to help them get started with the game, and in exchange, receive a portion of rewards! 
**Cons**
**Upfront investment required:** Games like Axie Infinity require you to buy NFTs to get started playing. 
**Time commitment:** Earning a reliable income from play-to-earn games typically requires a significant time commitment. You’ll likely need to play the game for multiple hours a day to earn meaningful rewards!
**Dependent on game success:** Your earnings from play-to-earn games are dependent on the game’s success. Often, the tokens you earn from playing a play-to-earn game increase or decrease in value based on the game’s popularity.

## Crypto affiliate programs 
**Difficulty:** Medium to hard
[Crypto affiliate programs](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/tools/crypto-affiliate-programs>) allow you to earn passive income by promoting cryptocurrency-related products or services. You can sign up for an affiliate program, receive unique referral links, and share them with their audience. When someone uses the affiliate link to make a purchase or sign up, you’ll earn a commission! 
**How to get started**
  1. Sign up for an affiliate program — such as programs offered by [CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/affiliate-program>), [Coinbase](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/www.coinbase.com/affiliates>), and/or [HaasOnline](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/www.haasonline.com/referral-program/>). Depending on the platform you are using, your application may require approval. 
  2. Once your application is approved, attach your affiliate link in your videos, blogs, podcasts, or other relevant forms of media and promote the product to your audience. 
  3. Once your audience signs up for the product, you will earn a commission. 


**Low barrier to entry:** Getting started with an affiliate program is usually quick and easy and requires no upfront investment — which makes it a low-risk way to get started earning passive income. 
**Recurring income:** Some crypto affiliate programs offer recurring rewards! For example, [CoinLedger’s affiliate program](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/affiliate-program>) offers a 25% recurring commission every time a customer buys a tax report! 
**Diverse offerings** : Crypto affiliate programs cover a wide range of products and services, including exchanges, wallets, trading tools, and educational resources, enabling affiliates to choose programs that align with their audience's interests.
**Cons**
**Designed for large audiences:** Cryptocurrency affiliate programs are typically designed for investors who have a large audience through mediums like YouTube, podcasting, or a blog! If you don’t have a large following, affiliate programs may not be a reliable source of passive income. 
**Variable:** Affiliate income can vary significantly based on factors like market sentiment. 
**Competitive:** Getting your audience to sign up for affiliate programs can be difficult. Many popular crypto influencers promote affiliate links — which means that competition is high! 
![Yield farming passive income](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/676f0692bb6db2151ea03342_64f8a74fe443dc86364e4e8c_Crypto-Passive-Income-v1-infographic-7.jpeg)
## Yield farming 
**Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
[Yield farming](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/yield-farming-taxes>) is the practice of using [DeFi](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/defi-crypto-tax-guide>) to earn high rewards! In contrast to staking and lending, the term ‘yield farming’ refers to a wide range of DeFi strategies — and often involves leveraging multiple DeFi protocols at a time. 
**How to get started**
  1. Find a decentralized application that offers high yield (often new applications will offer artificially high rewards to attract new users). 
  2. Deposit liquidity in the exchange. 


Yield farming requires deep knowledge of the DeFi ecosystem. To be able to navigate trustworthy decentralized applications, you’ll need to be an experienced cryptocurrency investor. 
**Pros**
**High rewards:** Yield farming can offer very high returns. Many DeFi protocols offer lucrative rewards to new users to incentivize usage! 
**Customization** : Yield farmers can use various strategies and platforms to optimize their risk and reward preferences! You can tailor your approach to suit your unique financial goals. 
**Cons**
**Protocol risks:** Unfortunately, the cryptocurrency space is filled with scams and fraud. It’s important to do due diligence on a protocol before you commit to locking up your funds! 
**Impermanent Loss** : Yield farming can lead to [impermanent loss](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/learn/what-is-impermanent-loss>) — which happens when the value of your crypto declines while being locked in a DeFi protocol! 
**Technical Expertise** : To get started with yield farming, you’ll need a solid understanding of DeFi protocols, smart contracts, and market dynamics. As a result, yield farming may not be the best option for beginner investors! 
![Crypto mining passive income](https://coinledger.io/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c99cf4f23700c8aa3752a/676f0692bb6db2151ea03357_64f8a75e87cf9c6af0db8ad0_Crypto-Passive-Income-v1-infographic-8.jpeg)
## Cryptocurrency mining 
**Difficulty: Hard**
[Cryptocurrency mining](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/how-to-handle-cryptocurrency-mining-on-your-taxes>) is the process of validating transactions on a blockchain network using [specialized hardware](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/tools/best-bitcoin-mining-hardware>). In exchange for contributing processing power, you’ll earn cryptocurrency rewards. 
**How to get started**
  1. Research electricity costs in your area and take a look at the [best coins for mining](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/tools/best-crypto-to-mine>) to determine whether mining will be profitable for you. 
  2. Set up a mining operation with [mining hardware](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/tools/best-bitcoin-mining-hardware>) and [software](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/tools/best-bitcoin-mining-software>). 
  3. Depending on your situation, you may need to set up an [LLC](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/crypto-llc-or-corporation-taxes>). Also, you will need to keep careful records of your profits and expenses for [tax purposes](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/how-to-handle-cryptocurrency-mining-on-your-taxes>). 
  4. Once you’ve completed these steps, you’re ready to get started mining crypto! 


**Pros**
**Reliable income stream:** Successful cryptocurrency miners receive a steady stream of passive income! 
**Technical learning:** If you’re interested in diving into the ins and outs of the blockchain, mining cryptocurrency can be a valuable learning experience. 
**Cons**
**High set up costs:** Setting up a cryptocurrency mining operation can be expensive and time-consuming. 
**High energy consumption:** Cryptocurrency mining requires significant amounts of electricity. Typically, miners will set up operations in regions where electricity is cheap. 
**High competition:** Blockchains like Bitcoin have high competition when it comes to mining — which means it can be very difficult for at-home miners to successfully validate transactions and earn rewards. 
## How to pick a crypto passive income platform 
If you’re looking to get started with a crypto passive income platform, you should take into account the following factors: 
**Reputation:** Unfortunately, the crypto ecosystem is rife with scams. You make sure you choose a crypto passive income platform with a strong reputation. 
**Centralized or decentralized** : Consider whether you want to use a centralized or decentralized platform to earn a passive income. While centralized platforms are easy to use, you may lose access to your crypto in the event of a bankruptcy. Decentralized applications are more difficult to use and are not recommended for beginners. 
**Knowledge of decentralized protocols** : If you’re planning to use decentralized protocols to earn passive income, you should take time to understand how to navigate these applications. Consider watching YouTube videos that can show you how to navigate the decentralized ecosystem. 
## Can I realistically make a monthly income from cryptocurrency? 
While it’s certainly possible to make income from cryptocurrency alone, it can be difficult and unreliable. The cryptocurrency market is volatile, and a market downturn can lead to a significant loss of income. 
For most investors, it’s recommended that cryptocurrency should be treated as supplemental income rather than a main source of income. 
## Is crypto passive income taxable? 
[Cryptocurrency is subject to tax](https://coinledger.io/tools/</guides/crypto-tax>). 
When you earn cryptocurrency, you’ll recognize ordinary income based on the fair market value of your crypto at the time of receipt. 
When you dispose of your cryptocurrency, you’ll incur a [capital gain](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-rates>) or [loss](https://coinledger.io/tools/<https:/coinledger.io/blog/how-to-handle-your-bitcoin-and-crypto-losses-for-tax-purposes>) depending on how its price has changed since you originally received it.
