## What is a SaaS Case Study?
A SaaS case study shows how a software company solved its business problems. It follows a clear format: problem, solution, and results. Each point is backed by real data.
For example, a SaaS startup faced a high customer churn of 8%. Their solution? A better onboarding process. The result? Churn dropped to 2%.
In another case, a B2B SaaS marketing case study highlighted how SaaS companies promoted their products. It often included [remote video testimonials](https://www.contentbeta.com/blog/saas-growth-case-studies/<https:/www.contentbeta.com/remote-video-testimonials-for-b2b/>) to showcase client satisfaction.
A strong SaaS case study covers six key areas:
  1. Company background
  2. Key challenges
  3. Strategy chosen
  4. Implementation steps
  5. Results and metrics
  6. Key takeaways


These case studies serve as practical guides for SaaS companies. Business leaders can study tested approaches and measure them against their own challenges. Each study reveals specific strategies, backed by data and concrete outcomes.
## 5 Inspiring SaaS Case Study Examples
Need fresh ideas? Here are five SaaS case study examples to explore:
  1. Directiq – How To Reduce Customer Support Tickets
  2. How Sendowl Grew Its User Base
  3. Chirotouch – Effective How-To-Videos
  4. Drift – Building a Multi-Million Dollar Brand
  5. The Journey of Outreach.io – From Startup to a $1.1 Billion


Let’s take a closer look.
### Saas Case Study 1: Directiq - How To Reduce Customer Support Tickets
In this SaaS case study, let’s see how DirectIQ uses videos as a **growth strategy** to reduce customer support tickets. The New York-based DirectIQ offers in-depth email marketing metrics. Using their easy-to-use email marketing interface, users can sign up for free and start their email marketing campaigns.
#### A. Strategy
  * No credit card is required for sign-up.
  * Email marketers can choose from hundreds of modern email templates.
  * Marketers can create new templates using an easy-to-use drag-and-drop editor.
  * Other features include unlimited sends, A/B campaigns, and email automation.
  * Premium features include Spam Doctor and Inbox Premium.


#### B. Tagline
Create Beautiful Email Campaigns For Free | No Credit Card Needed
The ‘Free’ and ‘No Credit card required’ act like magic in drawing the users to try their service. That’s crossing the first hurdle in your SaaS journey!
#### C. Outreach
DirectIQ wanted to:
  * **Educate their customers** about their product and improve product adoption.
  * Stand out in a crowded market and **differentiate itself from other companies**.
  * **Create appealing content** that gives their viewers a personalized experience about how easy to use the product.
  * Use a **hands-on approach** from top management. Have a look at the level of their commitment to customers, as exemplified by a quote from the CEO, Mr. Baris Ergin, on their website:
  * “At DirectIQ, we created the easiest to use platform for email marketing for businesses of all sizes. We listen to our clients and add new features continuously. Send us a message, and let’s talk! – Baris Ergin, Founder/CEO”


#### D. Takeaways
  * The perfect solution to address the pain points was a series of refined and powerful videos because ‘How-to videos’ are the easiest way to deliver useful information about your product to a wide audience. Such videos often include animated flow diagrams and screencasts, and [video marketing services](https://www.contentbeta.com/blog/saas-growth-case-studies/<https:/www.contentbeta.com/services/video/>) can implement them effectively.
  * The company’s far-sightedness in using a series of training videos resulted in reducing customer support tickets and **increasing user adoption**.


### Saas Case Study 2: How Sendowl Grew Its User Base
For growing a user base, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, let us look at the SaaS case study and explore the growth tactics used by SendOwl. This company helps businesses send and manage orders from their online store.
#### A. Strategy
We can see that SendOwl relies on a combination of two simple strategies: **Content marketing and SEO**.
  * **High-quality content that would appeal to their target audience:** By creating helpful blog posts and articles that address the needs of small business owners, they are able to attract new users and convert them into paying customers.
  * **SEO to rank their content for the keywords that were most important to their target audience:** This allows them to get high-quality traffic and build a following that would become valuable in the future.


#### B. Tagline
The wise way to sell & deliver your digital goods
In Western culture, the owl is associated with wisdom. Naturally, the wise, nocturnal bird finds a prominent place on their homepage. So, it is a clever synthesis of the company name and the tagline that effectively sums up the nature of their business.
#### C. Outreach
SendOwl says that their focus is on **making the customers happy** , and that they have relied largely on word-of-mouth publicity for their growth.
However, they also make it clear that they have nothing against some good publicity!
They even invite journalists, bloggers, and tweeters to talk about the company. The best part is that they even provide a Press Pack.
#### D. Takeaways
  * A **customer-centric approach** to business.
  * Clever use of digital and **content marketing strategies** to promote business.
  * Intelligent use of the **power of the words** to create the brand identity.


### Saas Case Study 3: Chirotouch - Transforming One-On-One Zoom Training Videos Into Effective How-To-Videos
Continuing with our examples of SaaS case studies, we present ChiroTouch, a fully customizable chiropractic practice management software. In this case study on SaaS, ChiroTouch uses videos as a growth strategy to improve the customer onboarding experience.
#### A. Strategy
  * Addressing customers’ pain points using simple and clear copy on their website.
  * Talking numbers in a convincing way – “Our easy-to-use software is loved, trusted, and enjoyed by 21,000 providers and 12,000 practices – for over twenty years.”


#### B. Tagline
Power your practice with ChiroTouch | It’s time to take your practice to the next level
Simple and direct. Who wouldn’t be enticed by the prospect of achieving GROWTH by being more productive?
#### C. Outreach
  * ChiroTouch effectively conveys the message that it’s not a practitioner’s job to worry about keeping their practice organized. Instead, they can rely on ChiroTouch’s cloud standard in chiropractic software to do it.
  * Explaining to the customers that regardless of the current size of their practice, why the product is a perfect fit.


#### D. Takeaways
They realized that well-made [customer onboarding video](https://www.contentbeta.com/blog/saas-growth-case-studies/<https:/www.contentbeta.com/blog/saas-customer-onboarding-videos/>) training was the way forward.The challenge, however, was that the videos had to appeal to a group of ‘not-necessarily-very-technical’ type of people.
Content Beta suggested a **hybrid model of live training and pre-recorded video courses** that the customers could refer to. Here is an example video from the series.

### SaaS Case Study 4: Drift - Building a Multi-Million Dollar Brand through Content Marketing
In this case study, we explore how Drift used content marketing as a key strategy to build a multi-million dollar brand. Despite entering a competitive industry of website chat, Drift managed to stand out by focusing on **brand building and creating superior content**.
#### A. Strategy
  * Targeting four specific audiences: marketers, salespeople, product managers, and entrepreneurs.
  * Featuring other companies in their content, opening their content to other audiences.
  * Following **SEO best practices** , such as – structuring URLs effectively and writing well-crafted meta-descriptions.
  * **Mixing content types** , using images, videos, and audio clips to break up text.
  * Using a **high number of backlinks**.


#### B. Tagline
Revolutionizing Website Chat with Superior Content Marketing
They believe in creating ‘six-star content’. This commitment to quality is reflected in a quote from their website: “At Drift, we aim to create better content than anyone else. We focus on **helping our audience and providing value**. Let’s connect and see how we can help you! – David Cancel, Founder”
#### C. Outreach
Drift aimed to:
  * Reach out to different types of target audiences through different posts.
  * Stand out in the crowd with content that is better than anyone else’s.
  * Featuring other companies and **using backlinks to drive organic traffic** to their website and attract a wider audience.
  * Use a **mix of content types** , including blog posts of various categories and podcasts, to guide the audience through their marketing funnel.


#### D. Takeaways
  * Focusing on specific audiences can help tailor content and make it more relevant and engaging.
  * A strategic approach to content creation can drive organic traffic, improve visibility, and attract viewers.
  * SEO practices can significantly improve search engine rankings.


### SaaS Case Study 5: The Journey of Outreach.io - From Startup to a $1.1 Billion SaaS Company
In 2011, Manny Medina teamed up with Andrew Kinzer to create GroupTalent, a revolutionary recruitment platform. However, the traction was slow, and they were running out of cash.
To solve their sales problem, they started **building software to make their sales reps more productive**. This software eventually became Outreach, a sales tech SaaS giant with over $60m in revenues and a valuation worth $1.3 billion.
#### A. Strategy
  * Pivoting to a product people actually want.
  * Closing the first 100 customers door to door.
  * Ignoring marketing for the first 2-3 years.
  * Developing an extremely fast-paced product release schedule.
  * Choosing a B2C Metric – monthly active users.
  * Developing a metric-driven outbound process.


#### B. Tagline
Outreach – The Sales Engagement Platform
Outreach is a sales engagement platform that helps businesses streamline their sales process, increase productivity, and drive revenue growth. It provides a suite of tools that enable sales teams to talk with customers more effectively and close deals faster.
#### C. Outreach
Outreach’s approach to growth includes:
  * Focusing on what they do well, which is **high-velocity sales**.
  * **Customizing their outbound process** based on the persona and industry.
  * **Acquiring Sales Hacker** to increase their online marketing presence.
  * **Creating a community** for their customers to build relationships and reduce churn.
  * Hosting an annual conference to share their vision, build relationships, and solidify partnerships.


#### D. Takeaways

  * Consider acquiring an audience instead of growing one from scratch.
  * Leverage customer relationships to reduce churn and increase customer retention.
  * Host events or conferences to build relationships and solidify partnerships.

## 🤔 Pros/Cons in SaaS Business
We come across examples of successful SaaS projects almost every day, whether it's communicating with colleagues on Slack or creating cool designs on Canva. However, it's important to pay attention to all the shortcomings of this business to be prepared for the significant challenges you may face. Let's explore this topic in more detail!
Pros | Explanation  
---|---  
Recurring Revenue | Subscription-based SaaS businesses usually generate a fairly predictable but regular recurring revenue. This produces safety and speed while forecasting future cash requirements easily.  
Scalability | A SaaS product has excellently scalable potential. After building the piece of software, it becomes easy to recreate and distribute to very large numbers of customers. Such scalability ultimately facilitates rapid growth as well as expansion.  
Cost-Effectiveness | Compared to conventional software development and distribution methods, the SaaS business model can be more cost-effective due to their centralized hosting and maintenance functionality. Since you can provide updates and company support to all customers simultaneously, this technique markedly reduces individual customer support costs.  
Flexibility and Accessibility | The typical cloud base within a SaaS company makes it highly flexible from an accessibility perspective and allows it to suit any type of device or operating system used by the customer. Enhancing user experience and convenience for end users is thus facilitated.  
Continuous Improvement | SaaS businesses have the advantage of gathering usage data and customer feedback. This data can be leveraged to make data-driven improvements, enhance features, and deliver a better user experience, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and retention.  
Now let's look at the cons 👇
Cons | Explanation  
---|---  
Stiff Competition | The SaaS market is extremely competitive, with a lot of big players and new competitors. You'll find it tough to leave your mark and capture market share by offering cutting-edge technology or high-quality service at a reasonable price.  
Infrastructure and Technical Challenges | Building and maintaining a robust and scalable infrastructure can be complex and costly. It requires investing in servers, data storage, security measures, and ensuring high availability to deliver uninterrupted service.  
Customer Acquisition and Retention | Acquiring and retaining customers can be demanding. The SaaS industry often involves a long sales cycle, and convincing potential customers to switch from existing solutions can be difficult. Additionally, customer churn can occur if users don’t find value in the product or if competitors offer better alternatives.  
Pricing and Revenue Model | Determining the right pricing strategy and revenue model can be challenging. Striking a balance between affordability for customers and profitability for a successful business is crucial. Pricing changes and finding the right pricing tiers can require experimentation and adjustments.  
Support and Maintenance | Support and Maintenance: Providing customer support and maintaining the software can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. It is important to have a dedicated support team to address customer inquiries promptly and continuously update and improve the product.

## 💪 Standing Out in the SaaS Market: Key Strategies for Success
Starting your SaaS business can be difficult for many reasons that we have already discussed above. As the industry continues to evolve, it becomes more difficult to stand out from the crowd. To succeed in the SaaS market, companies need to implement effective strategies that differentiate them from their competitors.
In this section, we want to give you some tips: how to stand out in a competitive market?
**1. Focus on solving the problems of a certain niche.**
One of the key aspects to helping your SaaS business stand out in a competitive market is to focus on solving a specific niche problem. Instead of targeting a broad general market, focus on the specific needs and requirements of a small audience.
Identify your strengths and resources that will allow you to effectively solve the problems of your chosen niche. Explore their needs and pain points, as well as the competitive landscape of the segment.
_Become an expert in your field!_
![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height='1128' width='1504' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' version='1.1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
![](https://stormotion.io/blog/case-studies-success-stories-of-businesses-that-built-and-launched-saas-applications/)![Focusing on solving the problems of a certain niche is a key strategy for success in the SaaS market. ](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/ordgikwe/production/f1142b67e29e52e7019eba98070799ba548bcc49-1504x1128.jpg?w=1504&h=1128&auto=format)
By catering to the unique needs and pain points of a well-defined target audience, you can provide highly specialized solutions that address their customers' challenges more effectively. (image by [James Oconnell](https://stormotion.io/blog/case-studies-success-stories-of-businesses-that-built-and-launched-saas-applications/<https:/dribbble.com/shots/20976902-Handful-of-tools>))
**2. Make sure there is a demand for your product.**
No matter how unique your product may be, without adequate demand, it won’t be successful and profitable. How to do it?
  * Research the market. Define your target audience, what pains and problems do your product solve?
  * Survey and analyze. Conduct several focus groups to find out their needs and expectations for the product. Analyze the answers.
  * Test it. In the first stage, you can offer your SaaS product to a limited number of customers for use. Feedback from real users will help you improve the product and fix possible problems.


The last step is absolutely crucial as it allows you to roll out the product as soon as it's even slightly ready and collect valuable feedback from real users. Their insights will significantly enhance your product and address potential issues you might have overlooked. Remember, done is better than perfect because real-world usage might differ from our initial assumptions, and making necessary pivots and adjustments early on is essential to success.
**3. Set up effective communication with customers.**
Customer feedback helps you understand their needs, gain valuable feedback, and ensure user satisfaction, increasing the likelihood of retaining and attracting new customers.
Make the feedback process with customers as simple and convenient as possible. Add all possible ways of support to your interface - chatbots, email, social networks, etc. And don’t forget about timely response to any problems of your customers.
**4. Innovate**
To stay ahead of the SaaS market, you must constantly innovate and improve your product. Monitor industry trends, customer feedback, and new technologies to identify areas for improvement. Regularly release updates and new features to give your customers an edge and stay ahead of the competition.

**5. Cooperate**
Partnering with other companies can help you expand your reach and differentiate your offerings. Find companies that fit your target market and offer mutual benefits. By using each other's strengths, you can create new opportunities, expand functionality, and increase your visibility in the market.

## SaaS case study example 1: ServiceChannel
![ServiceChannel case study examples](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### ServiceChannel case study example: Freshpet
[ServiceChannel](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/servicechannel.com/>) provides facility managers with a single platform to source, procure, manage and pay for facility maintenance and repair services from commercial contractors. The company is currently used daily by 500+ brands to manage over 50,000 contractors at 300,000+ locations in 63 countries. 
Check out the sales case study example we’re critiquing: [Freshpet Cuts Out Middleman for Asset Management, Improves Operations and Increases Customer Satisfaction](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/servicechannel.com/case-studies/fresh-pet/>).
### What worked well
#### 1. Strong executive summary: 
SaaS case study examples like this one kick off with an introduction to the customer’s business, and call out the benefits Freshpet received from working with ServiceChannel, as well as a few quantifiable [case study results](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-results/>). It’s an excellent example of an [executive summary](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/executive-summary-case-study/>) that provides a concise overview of the case study, giving the reader the highlights right away.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Defined structure and rich detail: 
The SaaS case study example clearly flows through Freshpet’s challenges and goals, as well as the solutions, benefits and results that the company got from working with ServiceChannel. 
The challenge section paints a compelling picture of Freshpet’s pain prior to working with ServiceChannel, and the solution section also includes why Freshpet chose ServiceChannel as a vendor—a valuable detail that’s often missing from case studies.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 3. Various design elements: 
ServiceChannel understands that no matter how powerful the storytelling in a case study is, you need a compelling [case study format](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-layout/>) to grab and keep your readers’ attention. This SaaS case study example hits the mark by incorporating strong design such as imagery, icons, bulleted lists and pull quotes.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 4. Useful metrics: 
This story includes several [case study metrics](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-metrics/>) to measure Freshpet’s success after implementing ServiceChannel’s solution. For example, it shows how Freshpet increased asset management efficiency by 53%. 
In addition, the statistics highlight where Freshpet started out for additional context: “The same number of Freshpet staff and contractors who had serviced 13,000 refrigerated units now service 18,000 to 20,000 units.”
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### What could be better
#### 1. Title choice: 
The current title of this SaaS case study example is trying to touch on several points. The [case study title](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-title/>) would be more focused and impactful if ServiceChannel used a statistic and added its company name, for example, “Freshpet Increases Asset Management Efficiency by 53% with ServiceChannel.”
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Links to products:
There are no links driving users to ServiceChannel’s product pages. This would be a useful addition to enable readers to more easily learn about products they’re interested in with a simple click, rather than making them do the work of navigating on their own.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 3. Customer quotes: 
The only 2 quotes in this case study are [case study testimonials](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-testimonial/>). Quotes are important to include to illustrate the customer’s perspective in their words. However, the case study would feel like more of a story with personality if ServiceChannel had included more customer quotes throughout the body text.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 4. Call to action (CTA): 
The [case study CTA](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-cta/>) is buried at the bottom of the page, underneath the “Related Content” section. As a result, most readers likely miss it. Try moving it up to a more prominent spot within the story. 
A CTA should use specific language that speaks directly to your prospective customers, as well as smart design (including colour and large text) to make your words pop off the page.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
## SaaS case study example 2: Zenefits
![Zenefits case study examples](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### Zenefits case study example: Skilljar
The [Zenefits](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.zenefits.com/>) People Platform brings everything HR related into one simple, single app. The company’s platform is designed to be comprehensive, but not overly complex. It puts benefits, payroll and HR access in the pockets and at the fingertips of employees.
Check out the SaaS case study example we’re critiquing: [Customer Education Company Taps Zenefits to Level the Playing Field for Talent in Seattle](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.zenefits.com/customer/skilljar/>)
### What worked well
#### 1. “Above the fold” section
The case study title, hero image and fast facts box are visually engaging and immediately draw the reader into the story. These elements pop on the lightly coloured web page background. This part of Zenefits’ case study is an excellent example of [case study design](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-layout/>).
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Compelling hero image
The image at the top of the SaaS case study examples like this one showcase the “people first” aspect of HR that’s integral to both Zenefits and its customer, Skilljar. The image is dynamic, colourful, and the people in the shot look happy and engaged.
#### 3. Fast facts box
This graphic element is brightly coloured and eye-catching. It also showcases important information such as the size of the customer company, Skilljar, and the Zenefits products that Skilljar purchased.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 4. Call to action (CTA) button
The orange “Try It Now” CTA button at the top right corner of the web page contrasts well with the white background, and stays in place as you scroll through this case study example. The CTA is obvious and clear.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 5. Strong introduction
This case study intro clearly explains what type of organization Skilljar is and why there is a need for the company’s services in the marketplace.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 6. Identifiable sections
The challenge and solution sections of this SaaS case study example are clearly marked, enabling the reader to follow along with the story easily.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 7. Pull quote
This is another example of great design, with graphics and an image to accompany the pull quote. Providing a headshot of the customer helps offer added social proof. The quote itself is also compelling and mentions Zenefits.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 8. Customer testimonials
This case study example features several good customer testimonials throughout, which speak to the impact Zenefits has had on Skilljar’s business. This is important because customer quotes carry more credibility with readers (potential prospects) than a company’s own version of a story.
#### 9. Closing CTA
In addition to the CTA button at the top of this case study, there’s a second CTA at the bottom of the page that offers the option to read customer stories, then talk to an advisor or try a product demo. It’s visually engaging with bright colours and clean design, communicating Zenefits’ message clearly and drawing the reader in.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### What could be better
#### 1. Title choice
The [case study title](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-title/>) is a bit long and clunky, and should include a stat for greater impact. For example, the title could mention that Zenefits helped Skilljar triple the size of its workforce.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Challenge section
This part of the case study doesn’t really describe the customer’s challenge before using Zenefits’ software. Rather than simply touching on Skilljar’s opportunity to improve, the challenge section should illustrate how much time and money it was costing the company by not having Zenefits. The section should also incorporate a customer quote.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 3. Solution section
The beginning of this section of this SaaS case study example would be stronger if the vendor selection process stood alone in a separate section, explaining why Zenefits stood out from other vendors. 
In addition, the section doesn’t really touch on the software solution itself until several paragraphs in. Be sure to link to product and service pages within your site to help the reader move through the buyer’s journey (and to improve SEO). 
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 4. Results section
This section should fall clearly under a header that says “Results” instead of the solution section of the case study. In addition, it could use more statistics to emphasize the pros of Zenefits’ solution—for example, how much time Skilljar has saved in the hiring process by using Zenefits.
## SaaS case study example 3: AppDirect
![AppDirect case study examples](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### AppDirect case study example: ADP
[AppDirect](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.appdirect.com/>)’s end-to-end cloud commerce platform connects channels, developers and customers to simplify the digital supply chain. The company enables its customers to onboard and sell products with third-party services—for any channel, on any device, with support.
Check out the SaaS case study example we’re critiquing: [ADP Streamlines HR Operations for Companies Worldwide](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.appdirect.com/customers/adp>).
### What worked well
#### 1. Overall design
This case study uses strong visuals to enhance the customer story and break up the text, including a video in the header, a sidebar, short paragraphs, lots of white space, a graphic element and a pull quote. It’s clear that AppDirect knows that strong design keeps readers engaged.
#### 2. Customer video
This brief [case study video](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-videos/>) clip gives the reader valuable background information on what ADP does and what the company’s pain points were before working with AppDirect. This is a great feature for audiences who prefer to consume video content rather than read text.
![AppDirect case study customer video](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 3. Useful sidebar
The sidebar in this SaaS case study example provides helpful information, offering insight into the longevity of the relationship between AppDirect and ADP, as well as the scale of ADP’s business.
![AppDirect case study sidebar](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 4. Pull quote
The customer pull quote acts as a strong visual call-out on the page and explains the value that AppDirect has brought to ADP from the customer’s perspective. This is important because it means more to readers to hear your customer’s opinion of your company than your (possibly biased) opinion.
![AppDirect case study pull quote](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 5. Call-to-action options
It’s essential to include an obvious call to action (CTA) at the end of your case studies. This piece features an interesting series of CTAs for different use cases.
![AppDirect case study calls to action](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### What could be better
#### 1. Title choice
While the title of this case study example nods to the results ADP got from working with AppDirect, it would be stronger if it included a statistic and mentioned AppDirect by name.
![AppDirect case study title](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Challenge section
This part of the case study reads like an introduction. The section explains what ADP is and what the company’s goals were when it sought out AppDirect, but doesn’t outline ADP’s pain points before implementing AppDirect. The pain points are only mentioned in the video. This challenge section should be changed to an introduction, and a true challenge section should be added for a [stronger case study format](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/components-of-a-case-study/>).
![AppDirect case study challenge](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 3. Vendor selection and implementation section
The written portion of this SaaS case study example doesn’t explain why ADP chose AppDirect or how the implementation process went. The customer mentions this in the video, but including this information in the text would be an opportunity for AppDirect to further highlight its value for readers who skip the video.
#### 4. Hard numbers
The results section of the case study could use statistics to drive home the benefits of working with AppDirect. Hard numbers are more impactful than qualitative statements.
## SaaS case study example 4: Expensify
![Expensify case study examples](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### Expensify case study example: Philz Coffee
[Expensify](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/use.expensify.com/>) is the world’s most widely-used receipt tracking and expense management app. The company helps its customers ditch spreadsheets so they have more time to focus on what really matters.
Check out the case study example we’re critiquing: [Philz Coffee – Mission: Happiness](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/use.expensify.com/case-study-philz>).
### What worked well
#### 1. Informative image caption
The small caption on the case study header image tells the reader that Philz Coffee has been an Expensify customer since 2014, offering insight into the strength and longevity of the companies’ relationship.
![Expensify case study image caption](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Useful executive summary
The ‘At a Glance’ summary shows which Expensify product Philz purchased, and highlights the features that Philz Coffee loves about Expensify, as well as what results the company achieved by using Expensify’s product. This [executive summary](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/executive-summary-case-study/>) provides valuable information for the reader before they even dig into the case study.
![Expensify case study executive summary](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 3. Descriptive customer quotes
This SaaS case study example effectively illustrates Philz Coffee’s pain points in the customer’s words, enabling readers to consider their own challenges and envision themselves benefitting from Expensify’s solution.
![Expensify case study customer quote](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 4. Strong design elements
It’s important to consider several [key design elements](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-layout/>) in your case study examples. Expensify’s case study on Philz Coffee uses a branded customer image and two pull quotes to break up the text. In addition, the piece is written in short paragraphs that are easy to scan, in keeping with best practice for web readability.
![Expensify case study design elements](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 5. Specific sections
The most powerful SaaS case study examples clearly lay out the steps of their customer’s journey. Expensify’s case study on Philz Coffee uses headers that explain what each section is about and walk the reader through the journey in a structured [case study format](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/components-of-a-case-study/>).
![Expensify case study specific sections](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 6. Clear call to action (CTA)
At the end of this case study, a prominent CTA invites the reader to enter their email address and sign up as an Expensify customer. An additional CTA, “GET STARTED TODAY” also appears as a button in the top right corner of the case study. These elements [guide the reader to the action](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/cta-examples/>) that Expensify wants the reader to take next.
![Expensify case study call to action \(CTA\)](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### What could be better
#### 1. Title structure
This section of the case study example would benefit from a rework. While the words “CASE STUDY” appear at the top in small print with the Philz Coffee logo underneath, it isn’t clear if “Mission: Happiness” is the title or a section header. This particular wording doesn’t explain what the case study is about or highlight the results Philz got from working with Expensify. 
“Philz Coffee reduces expense reporting time from days to hours with Expensify,” is an example of a strong title that names the customer and Expensify, and calls out quantifiable results. This would work well in the blue header area, while “Mission: Happiness” could remain as the introduction header.
![Expensify case study title](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Link to customer’s website
The case study should include a link to Philz’ website so that the content is a win-win for both Expensify and the customer. It’s important to help promote your customer so that they can benefit from the case study, too.
#### 3. Challenge/solution/results flow
The customer journey could be better defined. The header “Sweeter with Netsuite” should use challenge-focused wording, and this section should focus only on the customer’s problem. While the section does begin this way, it changes gear to talk about the results. Directly afterward, the case study backtracks to talk about the implementation process. It would make for a clearer flow if the results were not mentioned until after the implementation section.
#### 4. Links to other customer stories
It would be beneficial to include links to other Expensify case studies for readers who want to find out more about others’ experiences before signing up. While the case study does feature a sidebar that links to a customer page, call-outs to specific stories would add greater value.
## SaaS case study example 5: GitLab
![GitLab case study examples](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### GitLab case study example: Fanatics 
[GitLab](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/gitlab.com>) is a complete DevOps platform delivered as a single application. The company is changing the way development, security and ops teams collaborate and build software. From idea to production, GitLab helps teams improve cycle time from weeks to minutes, and reduces development costs and time to market.
Check out the SaaS case study example we’re critiquing: [GitLab offers Fanatics the CI stability they were searching for](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/about.gitlab.com/customers/fanatics/>).
### What worked well
#### 1. Strong title 
This benefit-driven title mentions both GitLab and its customer Fanatics. The title is also paired with a subtitle that further explains the results Fanatics got from GitLab’s solution.
![GitLab case study title](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Useful executive summary 
This is an [essential element for every case study](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/executive-summary-case-study/>) because it gives the reader an immediate understanding of your service. The section at the top of the Fanatics case study is easily digestible and includes information that sets the stage for the reader, such as:
  * fast facts about GitLab’s customer Fanatics
  * a brief overview of the solution
  * statistics to demonstrate results

![GitLab case study executive summary](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 3. Structured flow
This case study example clearly guides the reader through specific challenge, solution and results sections, with subheaders for each section that summarize what the reader will learn about.
![GitLab case study structure](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 4. The customer is the hero 
[Making your customer the hero in your case study](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/customer-hero-saas-case-study/>)—as opposed to tooting your own company’s horn—is an excellent way to achieve resonance with your readers. GitLab makes the interviewee, Fanatics’ cloud tech lead Guilherme Goncalves, the hero by highlighting how he advocated for change in his organization.
#### 5. Convincing quotes 
GitLab uses several [customer quotes](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-testimonial/>) to tell the story from Fanatics’ perspective, adding detail, credibility and personality to the case study. This is a solid tactic because it allows the reader to hear straight from the customer why they recommend GitLab’s service.
![GitLab case study quotes](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 6. Call to action (CTA) 
This SaaS case study example features a bar with a button to sign up for a free GitLab trial. The CTA appears at the bottom of the page and stays in view as the reader scrolls through the content.
![GitLab case study CTA](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### What could be better
#### 1. Statistic in the title 
Using a hard number in the case study title would help drive home the results that Fanatics got from GitLab’s solution.
#### 2. Product link 
Including a link to the continuous integration (CI) product that Fanatics purchased would guide the reader in a specific direction to learn more about GitLab’s offerings.
#### 3. Pull quote 
Adding a visual call-out between two of the sections would break up the case study text and give more weight to the story from the customer’s perspective.
#### 4. Design elements 
Solid [case study design](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-layout/>) is essential for grabbing and keeping your reader’s attention. GitLab could consider adding a headshot of the case study interviewee alongside a pull quote, which helps deliver instant credibility. A data illustration would also be useful to help visual readers process the numbers in the solution section.
#### 5. A look to the future
A paragraph on what’s next for Fanatics would help demonstrate how customers can grow with GitLab.
#### 6: CTA above footer 
While the case study CTA remains visible as the reader scrolls 95% of the page, it does disappear when the reader scrolls into the page footer itself. GitLab could address this so that the CTA is visible 100% of the time.
#### 7. Additional content 
Including a call-out linking to other customer stories would be valuable for readers who want to find more information before signing up for a free GitLab trial.
## SaaS case study example 6: ServiceNow
![ServiceNow case study examples](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### ServiceNow case study example: SAP SuccessFactors 
[ServiceNow](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.servicenow.com/>) makes the world of work, work better for people. The company delivers digital workflows that create great experiences and unlock productivity. ServiceNow’s IT service management (ITSM) and IT business management (ITBM) technology helps customers modernize IT, drive efficiency and enhance user experience.
Check out the SaaS case study example we’re critiquing: [Delta Air Lines Launches Services Portal with ServiceNow](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.servicenow.com/customers/delta-air-lines.html>).
### What worked well
#### 1. Prominent metrics
ServiceNow case study examples feature three metrics at the top of each story, immediately highlighting the value that the company’s products delivered to Delta Air Lines. The case study also includes more results in the form of hard numbers throughout the story.
![ServiceNow case study metrics](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Useful sidebar
The sidebar near the top of the case study provides educational ‘fast facts’ about the customer, Delta Air Lines. The sidebar also travels down the page with the reader as they scroll so that they can access the links to ServiceNow’s products at all times.
![ServiceNow case study executive summary](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 3. Strong quotes and testimonials
The [customer quotes and testimonials](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-testimonial/>) successfully paint a picture of the pain points that Delta Air Lines was experiencing prior to working with ServiceNow, and why the company needed to implement a technology solution.
![ServiceNow case study quote](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 4. Clear structure
This case study example clearly outlines Delta Air Lines’ challenges, then highlights the solutions provided by ServiceNow and the benefits the customer gained from ServiceNow’s products. The piece ends with a look to the future for Delta Air Lines, mentioning how ServiceNow’s solution will help the organization achieve its goals. This [case study format](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/components-of-a-case-study/>) creates a flow and helps the reader understand where they are in the story.
#### 5. Pull quote
The pull quote in the middle of the case study offers a [visually compelling element](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-layout/>) that breaks up the text.
![ServiceNow case study pull quote](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 6. Call to action
This SaaS case study example ends with a [clear, prominent and compelling call to action (CTA)](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/cta-examples/>) at the bottom right where the story finishes. This guides the reader to the action that ServiceNow wants them to take next—to explore demo videos.
![ServiceNow case study call to action](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### What could be better
#### 1. Title choice
The title of this case study example does not read smoothly, which makes it difficult to digest. It also doesn’t mention ServiceNow or include a statistic. Try to be more compelling with a [results-oriented title](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-title/>).
![ServiceNow case study title](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Flow of quotes
The challenge section of this case study example relies too heavily on quotes to tell the story, using three quotes in a row to illustrate the problem. Alternating between a regular paragraph and a quote from the customer interview makes for a more dynamic flow and enables customer quotes to have a greater impact. This approach also ensures that a case study does not simply repeat quotes from the interview to tell the story.
![ServiceNow case study flow of quotes](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 3. Lack of metrics in Results section
The Results section of the case study lacks metrics, despite the fact that there are great numbers showcased just under the title. Add metrics or KPIs to the body text to help provide the reader with a concrete picture of what they could expect if they started using ServiceNow. 
![ServiceNow case study - lack of metrics in Results section](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
## SaaS case study example 7: Splunk
![Splunk case study examples](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### Splunk Case Study example: Domino’s Pizza 
[Splunk](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.splunk.com>) is a data-to-everything platform that helps organizations ask questions, get answers, take actions and achieve business outcomes from their data. 
Check out the case study example we’re critiquing: [Domino’s Reveals Splunk as Its Secret Sauce](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.splunk.com/en_us/customers/success-stories/revealing-the-secret-sauce.html>)
### What worked well
#### 1. Title and subtitle combo
While different from typical SaaS case study examples, the title and subtitle are fun, clever and on-brand for Splunk. However, we would have liked to see “Splunk” in the title—for example, “Revealing the Secret Sauce: How Splunk helps Domino’s Pizza maintain position as the world’s #1 pizza company. (Psst, it’s the data.)”
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Video content
We all consume content differently. Splunk made a smart move by placing a video CTA right under the title of its case study examples. This is great for folks who would prefer to watch the story unfold rather than reading it. (See screenshot above.)
#### 3. Testimonial graphics
[Customer testimonials](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-testimonial/>) are not only more credible than a company singing its own praises—they also bring a story to life with personal anecdotes. The testimonials in Splunk’s Domino’s case study evoke emotion and stand out well with a strong blue background.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 4. CTA buttons
We give Splunk a thumbs up for offering 2 CTA options for readers at different stages of the buyers’ journey, with “Talk to Sales” as the bolded option. 
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 5. Engaging visuals
This SaaS case study example is full of relevant images that set the scene (pizza!) and fun infographics that add value by helping to illustrate the story and communicate the facts.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 6. Strong storytelling
It’s evident that Splunk’s team knows how crucial storytelling is in capturing a reader’s attention. This case study is well written and the quotes are weaved seamlessly throughout, adding a human element to the narrative.
#### 7. Customer is the hero
Splunk succeeds at [championing Domino’s](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/customer-hero-saas-case-study/>) by highlighting several of the company’s wins early on in the case study. This is a powerful tactic that helps readers see themselves in your customer’s shoes.
#### 8. Clear flow
The story is divided into 5 sections based on Splunk’s [case study components](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/components-of-a-case-study/>) for a successful user experience: simplicity, reliability, quality, trust, and innovation. This is a unique way to structure a case study and provides clarity for the reader. The graphics also incorporate Domino’s’ branding.
![](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### What could be better
#### 1. Pain points
This case study example seems to focus more on the customer’s aspirations than on the pain points that led Domino’s to Splunk. It’s generally understood that pain resonates more with prospects than aspiration. We’d like to see a dedicated “challenge” section that presents the problems and leads into how Splunk solved them.
#### 2. A defined story arc
This SaaS case study example lacks a beginning, middle, and end. There is no mention of what led Domino’s to purchase Splunk and how the implementation went. It also isn’t clear what changed or improved thanks to Splunk. And finally, the reader doesn’t get any insight into how Domino’s plans to use Splunk in the future. (Splunk could consider sticking with the traditional [case study format](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/components-of-a-case-study/>) so the reader can easily move through the challenge, solution and results sections of the story).
#### 3. Metrics
Stats are a surefire way to measure success in a B2B SaaS case study. The [lack of results-oriented numbers in this case study](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-metrics/>) is a big miss. We want to know how sales and productivity have increased since Domino’s implemented Splunk’s solution. Ideally, this information would appear within the story, as well as in a bulleted list for a quick overview.
#### 4. Executive summary
Speaking of an overview, an [executive summary](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/executive-summary-case-study/>) (or even a short set of bullets outlining the challenge, solution and results) would be an impactful addition to the top of all case study examples. It would enable the reader to understand the story at a glance.
## SaaS case study example 8: Zendesk
![Zendesk case study examples](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### Zendesk case study example: Airbnb
Check out the SaaS case study example we’re critiquing: [Airbnb’s custom 360-view of the customer](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.zendesk.com/customer/airbnb/>)
[Zendesk](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.zendesk.com>) is a CRM company headquartered in San Francisco with 17 offices worldwide. The company’s support, sales and engagement software aims to improve customer relationships for clients ranging from large enterprises to startups. Zendesk has over 150,000 customers in multiple industries.
### What worked well
#### 1. Strong CTA near the top 
Good SaaS case study examples guide the reader to where you want them to go next with a call to action. Zendesk’s Airbnb case study uses design to make its CTAs stand out. It’s fine to include more than one CTA in a case study, which Zendesk has done here.
![Zendesk case study CTA](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 2. Social media icons
Zendesk makes good use of graphic elements by placing social media icons near the top of the page. The layout is clean and adds visual interest to the piece, but doesn’t distract from the call to action (CTA) just below it.
#### 3. Striking imagery
Using visually compelling content throughout your case studies is a must-do if you want to keep your audience engaged—and Zendesk has nailed this. Fortunately, their customer Airbnb has lots of great imagery to work with.
![ServiceNow case study imagery](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 4. Impactful customer quotes
Great quotes help tell a human story that’s relatable and powerful. They also give your readers what they really want: [your customer’s opinion of your products](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/case-study-testimonial/>). No one wants to hear you drone on about how awesome your company is. Let your customer do the talking.
![ServiceNow case study quotes](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
#### 5. The customer is the hero
Zendesk does a fantastic job of [putting the spotlight on the customer](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/customer-hero-saas-case-study/>) by introducing Airbnb in an incredibly positive light. Throughout the case study, the story is told by Airbnb with lots of quotes, and explains how Zendesk simply provided a tool for Airbnb to run its business more effectively. 
#### 6. Strong storytelling
SaaS case study examples are only effective if they include a story arc to capture your readers’ attention. Zendesk does this expertly, beginning with Airbnb’s humble roots, then describing its wild success with over 100 million guests—and how that spurred the need for a solution that could help deliver high-quality customer service. The case study also evokes vivid detail like sitting in a “sun-drenched living room with a mug of steaming coffee.”
#### 7. Headers and subheaders
Not only does adding headers and subheaders to a case study help break up the text so readers can scan with ease—it’s an essential component of healthy search engine optimization. Zendesk’s Airbnb case study currently lacks these elements.
![ServiceNow case study header](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/)
### What could be better
#### 1. Executive summary
Including an executive summary in your case studies gives your readers the chance to [decide if the material is worth their time](https://www.upliftcontent.com/blog/saas-case-study-examples/<https:/www.upliftcontent.com/blog/executive-summary-case-study/>). It also means that if they don’t read the entire piece, they’ll still walk away with an understanding of your solution. Zendesk’s Airbnb case study would benefit from adding an executive summary.
#### 2. Clear challenge, solution and results sections
While Zendesk does tell a compelling story in this case study, it could help readers move through the story with greater ease by including more obvious challenge, solution and results sections.
#### 3. Obvious CTA at the end
With no CTA at the end of this SaaS case study example, Zendesk is missing out on a big opportunity. Currently, you read to the end of the case study and then see the footer. Think of what kind of results they could get if they added a “Book demo” button.
