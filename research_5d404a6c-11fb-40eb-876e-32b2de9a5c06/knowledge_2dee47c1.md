#  The Ultimate Guide to SaaS Pricing Models, Strategies & Psychological Hacks
By Ryan Law on Thu, Jun 27, 2024
Few things impact revenue as much as your pricing.
And yet, the average SaaS startup spends just  _six hours_ on their pricing strategy. That's not six hours a week, or six hours a month - [six hours,  _ever_](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<http:/www.priceintelligently.com/blog/why-you-should-change-your-saas-pricing-every-six-months>) _,_ to define, test and optimise everything.
It's understandable - with such an overwhelming number of pricing models, strategies and tactics available, it's almost impossible to know where to start.
So to simplify SaaS pricing, once and for all, we're explaining, exploring and analysing the three crucial components of a profitable SaaS pricing strategy:
  * the **pricing model** you'll use to balance value and revenue.
  * the **pricing strategies** you'll use to achieve your growth goals.
  * the **psychological pricing tactics** you'll use to fine-tune your price.


Read on to learn how to use each of these crucial tools to optimise your pricing, improve revenue and boost profitability. 
## SaaS Pricing Models Explained
Finding the right balance between value and revenue - your ability to help customers _and_ be fairly compensated for that help - will make or break your SaaS company.
Undercharge, and you'll cripple your business with uncompensated development and delivery costs; overcharge, and you'll throttle your growth and drive away thousands of would-be customers.
To help you get the most from your SaaS product, I'm looking at the seven major SaaS pricing models, and exploring the pros and cons of each.
Whether you're tied-up in tiered pricing or frustrated by freemium, the pricing models covered here should help you identify the optimum way to market, sell and grow your SaaS business.
### 1) Flat Rate Pricing
Flat rate pricing is probably the simplest way to sell a SaaS solution: you offer a single product, a single set of features, and a single price.
In this way, flat rate pricing bears a lot of similarities to the software licensing model used before cloud infrastructure existed, but with the added benefit of (usually) being billed monthly.
#### Examples of Flat Rate Pricing
Examples of flat rate pricing are few and far between (the most famous example from recent years, Buffer's _Awesome_ plan, is now one of many pricing packages the company offer) - but the practice is still used by [eCommerce SaaS CartHook](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/carthook.com/>).
A single monthly price of $300 (or $2,400 billed annually) grants access to all features of the company's product:
![CartHook - Flat Rate Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/CartHook%20-%20Flat%20Rate%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=513&height=696&name=CartHook%20-%20Flat%20Rate%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### Pros of Flat Rate Pricing
  * **Easier to sell.** Offering a single product at a single price makes it possible to focus every ounce of sales and marketing energy on selling a single, clearly-defined offer.
  * **Easier to communicate.** SaaS pricing models can get complicated, and quickly - but flat rate pricing is quick and easy for any would-be customer to understand.


#### Cons of Flat Rate Pricing
  * **Difficult to extract value from different users.** If you're targeting SMBs, and use an SMB-friendly pricing strategy, you'll miss out on a fortune in revenue if any Enterprise companies decide to adopt your tool.
  * **One shot at securing customers.** There's no nuance or flex in flat rate pricing: either would-be customers want the package, or they don't - and there's little you can do to sway them.


### 2) Usage Based Pricing
Also known as the Pay As You Go model, this type of pricing strategy directly relates the cost of a SaaS product to its usage: if you use more of the service, your bill goes up; use less, and your spend decreases.
In practice, this pricing strategy is most common within infrastructure- and platform-related software companies (like Amazon Web Services), where companies are charged based on the number of API requests, transactions processed, or gigabytes of data used.
Increasingly though, SaaS companies are finding new ways to adapt the model, like social media tools that charge for scheduled posts, or accounting tools that charge per invoice.
#### Examples of Usage Based Pricing
Usage based pricing works particularly well for recurring billing platforms like [Chargify](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.chargify.com/pricing/>) (editors note: they've been acquired since this post was first published): by directly correlating price with revenue, you can guarantee that price increases only happen alongside periods of increased revenue, ensuring that customers will always be able to afford and justify the change in price:
![Chargify - Usaged Based Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Chargify%20-%20Usaged%20Based%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=660&height=347&name=Chargify%20-%20Usaged%20Based%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### Pros of Usage Based Pricing
  * **Price scales alongside usage****.** It makes sense to correlate usage and price: if you have volatile demand, and use less of a service in a given month, why should you expect to pay the same amount as a boom month?
  * **Reduces barriers to use.** There are no big up-front costs with usage based pricing, and even the smallest startups can get started with your product, safe in the knowledge that prices will only increase alongside their usage.
  * **Accounts for "heavy user costs".** With fixed price packages, there's always the risk of "heavy" users taking up a disproportionate amount of your delivery resource, without compensating for it with increased spend.


#### Cons of Usage Based Pricing
  * **Disconnects value from the product.** Do your users really care about the number of API requests they generate? Or do they care more about seamlessly integrating two crucial pieces of software?
  * **Harder to predict revenue.** Usage based pricing typically means that billing amounts will vary month-to-month, making it much harder to forecast revenue.
  * **Harder to predict customer costs****.** The same problem applies to customers: those with volatile usage may see wild (and potentially unexpected) fluctuations in their monthly bill.


### 3) Tiered Pricing Strategy
Flat rate and usage based pricing are relatively uncommon in mainstream SaaS, and it's tiered pricing which is the de facto model used by most companies. At its heart, tiered pricing allows companies to offer multiple "packages", with different combinations of features offered at different price points.
The average number of packages on offer can vary hugely, [but the average clocks in 3.5](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<http:/onstartups.com/learn-by-example-38-saas-startup-pricing-pages-analyzed>) - often geared towards low, middle and high price points.
#### Tiered Pricing Example
Online storage company [Dropbox](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.dropbox.com/plans>) employ tiered pricing to great effect: each tier is designed around the needs (and budget) of a different type of potential customer, ranging from "for personal use" to "professionals" and "teams":
![dropbox-plans](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dropbox-plans.png?width=660&height=216&name=dropbox-plans.png)
#### Pros of Price Tiering
  * **Appeal to multiple personas.** With a single package, you have one shot to resonate with your target customer; with tiered pricing, you can tailor packages to suit multiple buyer personas.
  * **Leave less money on the table.** By appealing to multiple personas, you can maximise the revenue generated from different types of customer: offering a single $100 package will overcharge users with a $10 willingness to pay, and undercharge users willing to spend $200.
  * **C****lear upselling route.** When your customer outgrows their current package, there's a direct route to the next price point.


#### Cons of Price Tiering
  * **Potentially confusing.** Choices can quickly become overwhelming, and trying to decide between ten price tiers is a rapid route to an abandoned sale.
  * **Appeals to too many people.** It's tempting to create a wide range of packages to appeal to every possible need - but as the adage goes, you can't be everything to everyone.
  * **"Heavy user risk".** If top tier users regularly exceed their allocated service usage, you have no recourse for collecting extra revenue to compensate.


### 4) Per User Pricing
Spend a few minutes browsing pricing pages and you'll come away with the impression that Per User Pricing (also known as Per Seat Pricing) is the go-to SaaS pricing model.
Pacific Crest's annual SaaS survey backed-up these findings: across the companies surveyed, per user pricing was the most popular pricing model used.
This popularity can largely be attributed to simplicity: a single user pays a fixed monthly price; add another user, and that price doubles; add a third user and, you guessed it, the monthly cost trebles.
This makes it extremely easy for customers to understand what their monthly subscription buys them, and easy for SaaS startups to manage and predict their revenue.
#### Per User Pricing Example
For an archetypal use case of per user pricing, look no further than [roadmapping SaaS ProductPlan](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.productplan.com/pricing/>). The only variable in their Business Plan is the number of users added to the account, and the per use price is the same, whether you're a single user or a team of 100.
![Product Plan - Per User Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Product%20Plan%20-%20Per%20User%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=660&height=414&name=Product%20Plan%20-%20Per%20User%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### Pros of Per User Pricing
  * **Simplicity.** Per user pricing is one of the simplest, most direct pricing models, making it easy for would-be customers to calculate monthly costs: great for users, and great for simplifying the sales process.
  * **Revenue scales with adoption.** With this pricing model, revenue scales directly alongside adoption: if you're able to double the number of users within a company, you'll be rewarded with double the revenue.
  * **Predictable revenue generation****.** SaaS companies are reliant on the recurring revenue model, and per user pricing makes it easy to calculate and forecast each month's revenue generation.


#### Cons of Per User Pricing
  * **It limits adoption.** By charging per user, you provide a reason to avoid adding new users to the tool. This also provides an incentive to cheat, and wherever possible, share a single login between multiple team members.
  * **It makes it easy to churn.** By limiting adoption, you also make it easier for customers to abandon your service. After all, who's more likely to churn? A team of 100 people using your product, or a team of 10?
  * **It doesn't reflect the real value****.** Does it make a difference to a customer whether they’ve got three users or four?

> _When we first started using a project management tool, we used[ScrumDo](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/app.scrumdo.com/plans>): it was simple, lightweight, and fitted well with our workflow. _
> _But problems came when we wanted to add customers to the tool: despite the fact we were trying to spread the product into another company, and a whole new potential customer base, we were penalised by per user pricing._
> _Contrast that to something like[Gather Content](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/gathercontent.com/pricing-plans>): every plan offers unlimited users, and correlates pricing with Items and Active Projects. We pay more if we use more, and we're free to add as many users as we like_
> Will Steward, Cobloom
### 5) Per Active User Pricing
One variant of the per user pricing model is _active user_ pricing. Many SaaS companies (particularly those targeting the enterprise) encourage yearly billing cycles. This can mean that a new customer could pay for _hundreds_ of employees, up-front - without any guarantee that those employees would actually use the software.
Per active user pricing tackles this problem head-on, encouraging customers to sign-up as many users as possible, with the safeguard that only active users will actually be billed for.
#### Per Active User Pricing Example
[Slack](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/slack.com/pricing>) are the most famous example of this SaaS pricing model: no matter how many users you pay for, you'll only be charged for those that actually use the software.
> ![Slack quote](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Slack.png?width=640&name=Slack.png)
> _At Slack, you only get billed for what you use. So you don’t pay for the users that aren’t using Slack. And if someone you’ve already paid for becomes inactive, we’ll even add a prorated credit to your account for the unused time. Fair’s fair._
> [Slack](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/slack.com/pricing>)
![Slack - Per Active User Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Slack%20-%20Per%20Active%20User%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=660&height=463&name=Slack%20-%20Per%20Active%20User%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### Pros of Per Active User Pricing
  * **Customers only pay for active users****.** This means no money is wasted on unused seats: customers only pay for what they actually use.
  * **Reduces the risk of widespread adoption****.** If you're selling into an enterprise company, you want to encourage as much adoption as possible. Per active user pricing makes it easier for companies to take the risk and initiate a company-wide roll-out - if it doesn't work, they don't pay.


#### Cons of Per Active User Pricing
  * **Doesn't work so well for SMBs.** This pricing model works great for improving adoption in enterprise organisations, but when cash is tight and team sizes are small, per active user pricing doesn't offer much extra incentive to bite the bullet.


### 6) Per Feature Pricing
For the previous two SaaS pricing models, users were the common variable, but it's completely possible to use _features_ as your value metric instead.
Per feature pricing separates out different pricing tiers according to the functionality available in each, with the higher priced packages associated with a greater number of available features.
#### Per Feature Pricing Example
The primary differentiator between Evernote's Basic, Plus and Premium packages is the different range of features on offer, with new functionality "unlocked" with each upgrade.
![Evernote - Per Feature Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Evernote%20-%20Per%20Feature%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=660&height=431&name=Evernote%20-%20Per%20Feature%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### Pros of Per Feature Pricing
  * **Strong upgrade incentive.** Per feature pricing offers a clear and obvious motivation for upgrading: you unlock extra functionality.
  * **Compensate for delivery-heavy features.** Some of your features may require a disproportionate amount of resources to deliver - per feature pricing allows you to appropriately compensate, by putting these features into your top-tier packages.


#### Cons of Per Feature Pricing
  * **Difficult to get right.** How do you know which features your users will want? Getting the balance wrong can discourage adoption, as crucial features end up in overpriced tiers, or the bulk of your product's benefit ends up in your cheapest package.
  * **Leaves a bad taste.** It's easy to feel resentful with per feature pricing: you're paying a monthly fee to use a product, and still, you're missing out on some of their functionality.


### 7) Freemium Business Model
Thanks to high-profile success stories like Slack, Evernote and Dropbox, many SaaS companies use freemium pricing: offering a free-to-use product, supplemented by additional paid packages.
The freemium business model is typically used as part of a tiered pricing strategy: the regular paid packages are supplemented with a free, entry-level tier.
That tier is then limited across certain dimensions in order to encourage users to upgrade at a certain level of usage, typically employing feature-based (_if you want X feature, you need a paid package_), capacity-based (_if you exceed your allowance, you'll need a paid package_) or use-case (_you can use the free package internally, but not for managing customers_) limitations.
#### Example of Freemium Pricing
Live chat SaaS [Drift](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.drift.com/pricing/>) use freemium pricing to great effect (editors note: their pricing strategy has changed since this post was first published, but it remains a good example).
Their "Free" package allows small companies to talk to their first 100 contacts for free: when demand for the service increases beyond that point (most likely correlating with company and revenue growth), it becomes necessary to upgrade to their paid packages.
![Drift - Freemium Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Drift%20-%20Freemium%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=660&height=314&name=Drift%20-%20Freemium%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### Pros of Freemium Pricing
  * **It's a foot in the door.** Initial adoption is one of the biggest challenges facing a SaaS business, and the freemium model makes it as easy as possible for customers to get started with your product.
  * **Viral potential.** With such low barriers to use come significant viral potential: companies like Dropbox grew so rapidly because of user referrals, as their existing users passed on the product to friends and colleagues.


#### Cons of Freemium Pricing
  * **Freemium is a real revenue killer.** Free users don’t generate any revenue for your company. This means that your paid users need to generate enough revenue to support the [cost of acquiring and serving](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.cobloom.com/blog/saas-metrics>) all of your users - paid and free.
  * **It's easier to churn on a free package.** The more we pay for things, the more we value them. While a free-to-use version of your SaaS product makes widespread adoption simple, it also makes it easy for users to adopt a throwaway mentality, increasing churn as a result.
  * **It can devalue your core service.** If your product solves a painful, expensive problem for free, your users have may resent having to eventually pay for the service.

## SaaS Pricing Strategies
Your pricing model is at the heart of your SaaS business: it's the foundation that allows you to build out repeatable sales processes and generate recurring revenue.
But, within the framework of your pricing model, there are all-manner of different goals you'll need to hit on the way to your over-arching objective of "growth".
That's where SaaS pricing strategies come into play. Each of these strategies is suited to a different objective: whether that's rapidly expanding into a new market, or attracting particularly high-value customers.
### 1) Penetration Pricing
Penetration pricing is the strategy of reducing prices to rapidly gain adoption in a target market, and secure the "first mover" advantage: claiming market share before your competitors can beat you to the punch.
Land and expand strategies have been used to great effect by companies like Slack and New Relic.
In order to do so, companies often lower their prices to unsustainably low levels in the short- to medium-term, but aim to compensate in the longer-term, when they'll be able to upsell and cross-sell their large customer base onto a more profitable package.
This "land and expand" strategy has been used to great effect by companies like Slack and New Relic, using penetration pricing to grab the lion's share of the market before their competitors.
### 2) Captive Pricing
Captive pricing (also known as captive product pricing) is the practice of offering a "core" product for a lower-than-expected price, but charging extra for additional products that are required to get the most from the core product.
One classic example is the printer: most modern printers are sold for extremely low prices, but as soon as your ink runs out, you're forced into shelling-out for expensive, own-brand ink cartridges (the captive product), which are usually far more expensive than the printer itself.
For equivalent examples in software, imagine offering graphic design software at a nominal price, but requiring users to download stock imagery from the company's own stock photo service.
Or for a real-world example, the case of Adobe, offering older versions of their software for free, but gradually eliminating backwards-compatibility, forcing users to upgrade to an expensive paid version if they want to collaborate.
### 3) Skimming Pricing
Skimming pricing (also known as promotional pricing) is the strategy of setting a high initial price for a new product, before slowly lowering the price over time.
Skim pricing is sometimes referred to as "Riding Down the Demand Curve
Skimming pricing is sometimes referred to as "riding down the demand curve": as the product's price is lowered over time, it appeals to different sub-sections of the marketplace, and customers with different price sensitivities.
The best examples of skimming pricing can be found in tech: Apple products are famous for heavy discounting just a few months after launch, and in video gaming, prices steadily decline from release.
In SaaS, this strategy works because of the [Technology Adoption Lifecycle](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/</blog/the-biggest-problem-with-the-saas-product-adoption-life-cycle>): early adopters gain utility from the bragging rights of first access to new technology, and they'll often pay more for access to new products. As the product matures and prices are reduced, it begins to appeal to the later market.
### 4) Prestige Pricing
Prestige pricing (also referred to as premium pricing) is the strategy of maintaining high prices, in order to convey a sense of quality, exclusivity or luxury. In doing so, companies can maintain a (relatively) small customer base of high-value customers; customers that would likely abandon the brand if prices were to decrease.
There are a few ways to leverage prestige pricing in SaaS. If you're a well-known brand, or your product is used by high profile companies, you may be able to differentiate yourself by reputation, allowing you to charge a higher price in the process.
In other cases, it may be possible to offer a "premium" tier, containing best-of-everything features, rounded price points ($500 instead of $499) and additional recognition for being a "premium" customer.

### 5) Free Trial Pricing
Free trials are a staple of SaaS pricing strategies, and with good reason: by offering the product for free, for a limited time, you provide a quick foot-in-the-door. Customers can start using your product without any financial expense, and as long as they're able to benefit from the product during the trial, there's a strong incentive to upgrade when the trial ends.
Research by Totango shows that 44% of all SaaS companies offer a free trial. 
Free trials are typically time-limited ([the most common length is 30 days](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.cobloom.com/blog/ultimate-saas-statistics>)), but it's also possible to restrict it by usage (with the trial expiring after 5 invoices, 1 video file, etc.).
Crucially, [half of all free trial signups occur after the trial has ended](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<http:/www.madkudu.com/blog/50-of-saas-conversions-happen-after-trial-ends/>), so it's important to have a well-defined follow-up sequence.
### 6) Cost Plus Pricing
Cost plus pricing (also referred to as cost based pricing) serves as a starting point for many SaaS companies. Developing, marketing and selling a product takes resources and, of course, money: cost plus pricing is the practice of adding a target profit margin to those costs (say, 20%), and setting that as the price for your product.
Cost plus pricing doesn't take into account competitor pricing, the perceived value of the product, the price sensitivity of their customers, or any of the other inputs that should influence pricing. But pricing discussions have to start somewhere, often with limited information - and in these instances, cost plus pricing can be a useful framework for kick-starting your thought process.
### 7) Value Based Pricing
Cost plus pricing is very company-centric: it's an exercise in choosing the profit the company wants, with little regard for the customer that supplies that profit. Value based pricing works in stark contrast, using the perceived value of the product as the benchmark for price setting, instead of costs, competitors or target margins.
If you're looking for a good starting point, check out the 10x Rule.
At its heart, value based pricing encourages SaaS companies to view their pricing strategy as a product of the value they provide. Instead of fixating on cost-cutting to improve profit, companies focus on improving the service and value they provide, using extensive research to understand how customers actually value a product.
Value based pricing isn't a quick-win - it's a long-term change to how prices are fundamentally viewed - but if you're looking for a good starting point to transition to value based pricing, check out the 10x Rule. In simple terms, it's the idea that the value your product provides should be _ten times_ its price, providing a simple heuristic for framing your pricing decisions.

## Psychological Pricing Tactics
Even after you've decided on your SaaS startup's pricing model, and settled on your strategy, there's still room to dramatically improve your price.
That's where psychological pricing strategies come in. Think of these like the icing on the cake: smaller experiments that can be used to fine-tune and optimise your pricing.
There's a degree of stigma associated with pricing psychology, perhaps rightly so: I've seen companies use the power of psychology to exploit and mislead customers.
Thankfully, the strategies deployed here aren't designed to coerce unwitting customers into buying more than they want: we're simply working alongside the brain's innate processes to reduce friction, and make the sales process as effective and efficient as possible.
### 1) Price Anchoring
Price is a relative concept, and when we assess the price of something, we use a reference point to work out its value. If we were buying a car, we'd compare its price to the price of other cars on the lot, or on eBay; an item of jewellery, and we'd turn to similar pieces in the jewellery shop next door. Price anchoring is a way to leverage this heuristic to increase your customer's willingness to spend.
For example: 
> Imagine you're buying a shirt.
> When you enter the store, you have a clear budget in mind - $50 - but you soon find yourself steered towards a display of high-end suits by the enthusiastic salesman. The suits are all over $2,000, and though you humour the salesman, you have no intention of buying one.
> A few minutes later and you find yourself standing in front of a display of shirts, starting at $100 apiece. With the $2,000 price tag fresh in your mind, paying $100 for a shirt seems reasonable.
> Before you know it, you're stood at the checkout with your new shirt.
Before entering the store, you had a price of $50 in mind, and spending $100 was a huge price increase. But after the salesman's slick manoeuvring, your subconscious price reference became a massive $2,000 – and that $100 seems much smaller in comparison.
#### Price Anchoring Example
CRO SaaS [Convert](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.convert.com/pricing/>) use price anchoring to great effect on their pricing page.
Their lowest priced package is $199, but by positioning their most expensive package on the left of the page (and therefore the first package would-be customers come across), both their Specialist and Entry packages seem like relatively good value in comparison.
![convert-plans](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/convert-plans.png?width=660&height=403&name=convert-plans.png)
#### How to Use Price Anchoring in SaaS
  * On your pricing page, **draw attention to your most expensive package** , even if most people don't buy it. Your top tier package becomes the visitor's price "anchor", making your other packages look more affordable in comparison.
  * When up-selling or cross-selling, **start by pitching your most expensive upgrade or add-on** , before working down to your more "reasonably" priced options.


### 2) Charm Pricing
Charm pricing refers to the use of prices ending in the number nine.
It's suggested that this psychological pricing strategy works because of the "Left Digit Effect". Our brains process numbers extremely quickly, making snap judgments about prices and values without any conscious awareness. When we see a $400 product, our brain latches on to the first number - the left digit - and creates an accurate, subconscious reference point of $400. But when we see a $399 product, that same Left Digit Effect creates an inaccurate reference point of $300.
Though we don't consciously believe we're buying a $300 product, charm pricing has been show to significantly increase sales and conversion rates, as this experiment from online marketplace Gumroad demonstrates:
![](https://www.cobloom.com/hubfs/SaaS_Pricing_Hacks_3.png?t=1486739840653)
#### Charm Pricing Example
In _Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value,_ William Poundstone's famous meta-study found that charm pricing (like $399) outsold rounded price points ($400) by 24%. Though the difference could be accounted for by virtue of lower price, [MIT's famous study](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<http:/api.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_143498249850210&key=a8b3db45c5a4f36e59ba21e41d544c09&libId=ib7n7vfj0100zhxn000DA2t61iwyltc53&subId=313&loc=http%3A%2F%2Fmarketeer.kapost.com%2Fb2b-pricing-strategy%2F%23axzz3dUvCBc43&v=1&out=http%3A%2F>) found that clothing priced at $39 outsold identical items priced at $44 and, unbelievably, $34.
With that in mind, it's not surprising that so many SaaS companies use charm pricing, like this example from IFTTT:
![IFTTT - Charm Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/IFTTT%20-%20Charm%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=660&height=355&name=IFTTT%20-%20Charm%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### How to Use Charm Pricing in SaaS
  * **Run an A/B test to monitor conversion rates** for a round figure monthly subscription (like $60), and a price ending in nine ($59). If you're feeling really adventurous, you could even test a higher charm price (like $69).


### 3) Odd-Even Pricing
Odd-even pricing works on a similar principle to charm pricing: prices are reduced by a few dollars to bring them just under the nearest "rounded" price point. Whereas charm pricing exclusively uses prices ending in nine, odd pricing uses, you guessed it, odd numbers - think $7.47, $97 or $493.
Charm pricing is an extremely common pricing strategy - so common that it's even possible that we're developing new heuristics to overcome its psychological impact, and correctly associate a $399 product with a $400 price tag.
But odd-even pricing is less commonly used, and that novelty value can be enough to trigger the Left Digit Effect: when customers are growing blind to charm pricing, offering something for $37 a month might be enough to increase your conversion rates.
#### Odd-Even Pricing Example
[Zapier](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/zapier.com/pricing/>) take this approach to extremes, with their seemingly random pricing strategy:
![zapier-pricing](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/zapier-pricing.png?width=660&height=411&name=zapier-pricing.png)
Like odd pricing, even pricing applies the same principle with even numbers, as demonstrated by virtual assistant [SaaS Zirtual](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.zirtual.com/plans-pricing/>) (editors note: they now use odd pricing, perhaps for a reason!)
![Zirtual - Odd-Even Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Zirtual%20-%20Odd-Even%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=660&height=241&name=Zirtual%20-%20Odd-Even%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### How to Use Odd-Even Pricing in SaaS
  * **Review your competitors' pricing strategies.** If charm pricing is the dominant approach, opt for odd-even pricing instead. As always, use A/B testing to monitor the impact the change has on conversion rates and sales revenue.


### 4) Product Bundle Pricing
Product bundle pricing is the practice of offering several products for a single price.
Typically, the bundle price would offer each component product for less than its individual price (assuming it's even possible to buy the products individually), but because the bundle encourages the sale of products that might not otherwise be bought, can still represent an increase in overall profit.
Product bundle pricing is great for simplifying complex sales process, especially when a multitude of apps and add-ons are available. It's also great for drawing focus away from the individual product prices, and encouraging outcome-oriented thinking: customers are encouraged to think about the value of a "productivity suite" or "design studio", instead of individual SaaS products.
#### Product Bundle Pricing Example
For an example of product bundle pricing, look no further than [Microsoft's Office 365 suite](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/products.office.com/en-gb/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans>). Office products are now available exclusive through a monthly subscription service, and there's no way to pick-and-choose which products you want to pay for, and which you don't.
![microsoft-365-plans](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/microsoft-365-plans.png?width=660&height=267&name=microsoft-365-plans.png)
I use Word, Excel and Powerpoint on a daily basis, and would gladly pay for each application - but I wouldn't touch Sharepoint, Outlook or Exchange. But because the products are bundled together, I pay a flat monthly fee, and I have a whole host of Office products installed on my desktop.
#### How to use Product Bundle Pricing in SaaS
  * If you offer a range of standalone products, **try offering them as a single bundle.** This can be especially effective for encouraging the sale (and use) of more niche products, by selling them alongside more popular products.


### 5) High-Low Pricing
High-low pricing is most commonly used in the retail industry, but it does have some application in SaaS. In essence, high-low pricing is the act of alternating between a "high" price and a "low" price: a product is marketed at a premium price, before eventually being reduced to a lower, discounted price.
High-low pricing uses price anchoring to encourage sales: the product's value is associated with the original "premium" price, so when a discount is applied, customers view the reduced price as a particularly great deal.
But a word of warning: high-low pricing will drive-up demand in the short-term, but long-term discounting is dangerous. If you regularly discount your product, you risk anchoring the product's perceived value to that lower price, and create a culture of bargain hunting where customers will wait for a deal before ever purchasing your product.
#### High-Low Pricing Examples
Black Friday is the most blatant example of high-low pricing used in SaaS, with all-manner of typically restrained SaaS companies deciding to slash their prices in an attempt to capitalise on the consumer frenzy:
![Grammarly - High-Low Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Grammarly%20-%20High-Low%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=660&height=550&name=Grammarly%20-%20High-Low%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### How to Use High-Low Pricing in SaaS
  * **If you're going to use high-low pricing, use it very sparingly** : discounts need to feel like truly exceptional, once-in-a-lifetime deals, so reserve them for serious promotion drives, or use them to [solicit powerful social proof for your business](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.cobloom.com/blog/how-to-create-powerful-social-proof-with-free-survey-tools>).


### 6) Trial Pricing
Trial pricing involves offering your SaaS product at a discounted rate for a limited period, often as a part of an introductory promotion. Whereas the industry-standard free trial is, as the name suggests, free, trial pricing still charges the customer a lower-than-normal fee.
Trial pricing reduces the barriers to actually _starting_ with your product, with the idea being that once a customer has seen how useful your product is, they'll be more than happy to pay the increased rate after the trial expires.
The most common example of trial pricing I've come across is the (infamous) $1 trial: instead of offering customers a free trial, they're asked to shell-out a dollar for the privilege.
This may seem more desirable on the surface, but a $1 trial requires a credit card, where a free trial doesn't. This is a huge barrier to sign-ups: it inconveniences your would-be customer, and risks devaluing your product when the regular subscription kicks in (_"$40 a month? I was paying $1 before!"_)
#### Trial Pricing Examples
Most of the companies I've seen using trial pricing fall toward the shadier end of the business spectrum, often using the approach in combination with other less-than-savoury tactics, like auto-renewing for a higher price (as demonstrated by [Digital Marketer](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/digitalmarketer.com/secure/lab-trial/join/>)).
![Digital Marketer Lab - Trial Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Digital%20Marketer%20Lab%20-%20Trial%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=593&height=423&name=Digital%20Marketer%20Lab%20-%20Trial%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### How to Use Trial Pricing in SaaS
  * **If you're going to offer a trial, make it free.** Trial pricing carries with it the same risks as high-low pricing and discounting, with the added disadvantage of lowering signups and conversion rates.


### 7) Analysis Paralysis
The psychological pricing strategies covered here are designed to work alongside the brain's decision-making framework. Analysis paralysis (also know as the paradox of choice) is an example of a heuristic your pricing strategy needs to avoid triggering.
Research suggests that the maximum number of objects a person can hold in working memory is [7±2](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two>). If a decision requires the assessment of a greater number of choices (say 10), it becomes much harder to remember the choices on offer, and accurately decide between them.
This means that, past a certain point, there's an inverse relationship between number of choices and decisions made. The most famous example of this is Columbia University's [study into jam sales](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<http:/faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Iyengar%20%26%20Lepper%20\(2000\).pdf>): when customers were offered a range of 24 jam flavours, 3% went on to make a purchase. But when the choices were restricted to just 3 flavours, 30% went on to buy.
#### Analysis Paralysis Examples
[Intercom](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.intercom.com/pricing>) offer a range of products, and a whole host of variables which can alter pricing: features, teammates, messages, people reached...
Though they've done an admirable job at bundling the packages together, there's still a huge amount of choice available. Do I want _Acquire Lite_ or _Acquire Standard?_ What about _Engage Lite_ or _Engage Standard_ , or _Resolve Lite_ , or _Resolve Standard?_ What's the _Educate_ package?
![Intercom - Analysis Paralysis Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Intercom%20-%20Analysis%20Paralysis%20Example.png?width=660&height=423&name=Intercom%20-%20Analysis%20Paralysis%20Example.png)
#### How to Avoid Analysis Paralysis in SaaS
  * The biggest, most successful SaaS companies have an **[average of 3.5 packages](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<http:/onstartups.com/learn-by-example-38-saas-startup-pricing-pages-analyzed>) **available on their pricing pages. This relatively low number makes it easy to compare packages and find the best fit, without succumbing to the confusion and complexity of analysis paralysis.


### 8) Decoy Pricing
Decoy pricing is the use of a seemingly redundant pricing option (something that's obviously less desirable than the other products on offer), in order to influence how customers choose between the remaining products.
This is how the Economist once priced subscriptions: an online subscription for $59, a print subscription for $125, or a combined print and web subscription for.... $125:
![](https://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/economistpricing-1.jpg)
Crucially, the print option isn't designed to sell subscriptions: it's designed to make the combined subscription more appealing in comparison. Without the print-only option, online subscriptions are valued at $59, and the value of a print subscription is implied to be $66:
![](https://cobloom.download/latex.php?formula=%5Ctext%7BCombined%20Subscription%20%7D\(%24125\)-%5Ctext%7BOnline%20Subscription%20%7D\(59\)%3D%5Ctext%7BPrint%20Subscription%20%7D\(66\))
Introduce the print only option, and the implied "real" value of the combined subscription shoots up, from $125 to $184. By introducing a nonsensical price point, the most expensive package becomes the most desirable – offering an implied _saving_ of $59 over its "true" value:
![](https://cobloom.download/latex.php?formula=%5Ctext%7BPrint%20Subscription%20%7D\(125\)%2B%5Ctext%7BOnline%20Subscription%20%7D\(59\)%3D%5Ctext%7BCombined%20Subscription%20%7D\(184\))
When [Dan Ariely tested the impact of this psychological pricing strategy](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.paulolyslager.com/decoy-effect-price-tables/>), he found that the decoy effect generated an additional 30% in revenue from the same number of sales.
#### Decoy Pricing Examples
Here's a relevant example from a subscription-based company, [Shutterstock](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<https:/www.shutterstock.com/subscribe>).
On the left, their "Basic" package offers 25 images for €179, but their middle option offers 750 images per month, for a price between €159 and €199, depending on the package you choose. That's _thirty times_ as many images, for the same average price.
![Shutterstock - Decoy Pricing Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Shutterstock%20-%20Decoy%20Pricing%20Example.png?width=660&height=302&name=Shutterstock%20-%20Decoy%20Pricing%20Example.png)
#### How to Use Decoy Pricing in SaaS
  * Whether you offer different pricing packages or a range of add-on prices, you can**use the decoy effect to frame particular offer** s. For example, you could offer a "Basic" package with 50 users for $100/m, a "Pro" package with 100 users for $150/m, and offer "50 Additional Users" as a standalone add-on for $150/m.


### 9) Center Stage Effect
The center stage effect refers to the psychological preference people have for the middle item in a selection of three choices. The [main theory behind the preference](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/<http:/www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740809000291>) is that "_Consumers believe that options placed in the center of a simultaneously presented array are the most popular_ ".
This might be because the "middle" option in a selection of three is usually perceived as the "average" choice: the middle choice is usually sandwiched between two extremes, Small and Large, or Cheap and Expensive. For the average customer, choosing the average option is probably a safer bet than taking a risk on something that might be too extreme across a particular dimension.
There's also a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation here: middle options might be perceived as popular because the center stage effect is itself increasingly popular, and usually combined with strong elements of social proof, like "Most Popular" labels.
#### Center Stage Effect Examples
The center stage effect is common in SaaS, and chances are, most pricing pages you'll visit will leverage it in some form.
Gather Content had a clear, effective application on their pricing page: their "Plus" plan has a "Most Popular" label, a coloured CTA button where the others are white, and the column is even slightly offset from the others to further highlight it.
![Gather Content - Center Stage Effect Example.png](https://www.cobloom.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Images/blog/SaaS%20Pricing%20Models/Gather%20Content%20-%20Center%20Stage%20Effect%20Example.png?width=660&height=440&name=Gather%20Content%20-%20Center%20Stage%20Effect%20Example.png)
#### How to Use the Center Stage Effect in SaaS
  * If you offer three pricing packages, **use visual callouts to highlight the most popular package** , or alternatively, to highlight the package you'd _like_ to be most popular.

### **Key Learnings:**
  * Companies will often have multiple usage metrics built into their plans (e.g. Storage Space and Video Hours), which increase the likelihood of users encountering at least one of these limits to get them to upgrade.
  * Usage Subscription tiers typically include an increasing number of features, so customers upgrading from one tier to the next will get higher limits and more features.


### **Implementation Tip:**
Having usage-based features in your plans gives you a great opportunity to let your users discover and test those features. This is why companies like Wix include these features in all plans and set the limits such that users can try them, but they will need to upgrade once they consistently use them.
## **Usage Pay as You Go**
Pay-as-you-go pricing model is where customers pay only for what they have consumed within a given period. This means that their bill every month will go up or down, depending on their usage.
![user based pricing](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/paragraphs/intro/2023-05/pricing-models/diagram-usage-pay-as-you-go.jpg)
### **Pricing Model Example:** Algolia
![Algolia](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/paragraphs/intro/2023-05/pricing-models/pricing-model-example-Algolia.jpg)
### **Key Learnings:**
  * Pay as you go has a very low barrier to entry as companies rarely impose miumums
  * This model is most common in Development & Infrastructure tools, such as Twilio, AWS or Agolia.


### **Implementation Tip:**
Pay as you go model may have unpredictable revenue as customers are not committed to any spend. To add some “predictability” to your revenue, you can add a committed amount at a discount, the way Amazon AWS does “reserved instances” for their EC2 product.
## **Usage Drawdown**
Usage Drawdown model is similar to Pay-as-you-go, however the main difference is that the usage limits are determined up-front and then users consume it (or drawdown) throughout the billing period and then it resets again at the beginning of the next billing period.
![diagram-usage-drawdown](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/paragraphs/intro/2023-05/pricing-models/diagram-usage-drawdown.jpg)
### **Pricing Model Example:** TypeForm
![Typeform](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/paragraphs/intro/2023-05/pricing-models/pricing-model-example-Typeform.jpg)
### **Key Learnings:**
  * Usage drawdown limits can be spread across different tiers (e.g. Typeform) or they can have or within the same tier (e.g. ShutterStock)
  * Companies often provide discounted per unit price with higher limits (e.g. Typeform offers 1000 responses for $50 USD and 10,000 responses for $83 USD)


### **Implementation Tip:**
Consider what happens when your users hit the limit within their tier. Beside having them upgrade to the next tier, another option is to allow users to reset their billing period. This is exactly what ScrapingBee does - if you hit your limit before the end of the month - you can then reset your billing cycle right there and then, which means you will get billed for the next month today in exchange for a reset of your limit.
## **Tiered (Feature Based) Pricing**
Tiered (or Feature Based) Pricing Model is a subscription model with different tiers that are solely differentiated based on features. Users buy a plan based on features that they want to access in the product.
![diagram-tiered-pricing](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/paragraphs/intro/2023-05/pricing-models/diagram-tiered-pricing.jpg)
### **Pricing Model Example:** LinkTree
![Linktree](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/paragraphs/intro/2023-05/pricing-models/pricing-model-example-Linktree.jpg)
### **Key Learnings:**
  * Feature based tiering is very rare among top SaaS companies, as it offers very limited opportunity to upsell customers (i.e. once someone reaches the highest tier, it’s the max that they will ever pay)


### **Implementation Tip:**
Consider how you will let users discover the additional features in higher tiers. One option is to give users an option to do a “reverse trial”, which means that they can upgrade to a higher tier to try the additional features, but they get downgraded to their existing tier if they choose not to keep it.
## **Flat Base Pricing**
Flat based pricing means the same price for everyone, no matter what. This model has the least flexibility and is typically used for new product or SaaS companies to test out initial pricing, but rarely observed in larger companies.
![flat-base-pricing](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/paragraphs/intro/2023-05/pricing-models/diagram-flat-base-pricing.jpg)
### **Pricing Model Example:** SurfShark
![Surfshark](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/paragraphs/intro/2023-05/pricing-models/pricing-model-example-Surfshark.jpg)
### **Key Learnings:**
  * Just like Tiered based pricing, Flat pricing is very rare among top SaaS companies, as it offers no revenue expansion opportunities with clients.


### **Implementation Tip:**
Since flat based pricing is often used to test new products and/or initial pricing, experiment with different price points to test willingness to pay.
## **Performance-Based Pricing**
Performance-based pricing is a pricing model in which customers are charged based solely on the results they achieve. This approach ties the price to a specific value metric, such as the number of leads generated, or the savings realized through the use of the product. As a result, the amount due per period can fluctuate based on the level of performance achieved.
![performance-based-pricing](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/paragraphs/intro/2023-05/pricing-models/diagram-performance-based-pricing.jpg)
### **Pricing Model Example:** Vendr
![Vendr](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/paragraphs/intro/2023-05/pricing-models/pricing-model-example-Vendr.jpg)
### **Key Learnings:**
  * Performance based pricing is relatively new to SaaS
  * The great thing about performance based pricing is that it aligns customer and vendor interests, however the measurement and administration of this type of pricing can get pretty complicated pretty quick


### **Implementation Tip:**
Since performance may be influenced by many factors, consider securing annual based contracts (like Vendr) at an agreed price with a money back guarantee. This will give you revenue predictability as well reduce the risk of customers churning after one month of bad performance.
## **Freemium Pricing**
Freemium deserves a mention in this article, as it is often mentioned in the context of SaaS pricing, however it is not a pricing model. It is an acquisition model. It is used to acquire paid customers by first giving away some part of the product for free. This tactic relies on users developing product usage habits and then leveraging that relationship to sell them a paid version of the product.
Freemium can be combined with any of the above pricing models.
## Keep On Improving Your Pricing and Packaging
The variety of SaaS pricing examples among these 250 companies proves that there are no “one size fits all” approaches to monetizing SaaS. In fact, many SaaS companies will combine multiple pricing models to maximize revenue for their revenue.
As you are thinking about pricing your first product or updating your existing pricing, the best starting point is to see what peers and competitors are doing in your space.

Here's a fun fact: A 1% improvement in how you monetize[can lead to a 12.7% increase in profit](https://sbigrowth.com/insights/</hubfs/1-Research%20Reports/01.2025%20Anatomy%20of%20Pricing/SBI_Price_Intelligently_AnatomyofSaaSPricingStrategy.pdf>). 
If your SaaS company doesn’t have a pricing strategy in place, you’re leaving huge revenues on the table. Defining your SaaS pricing model is one of the most important steps you can take for business success.
Companies pour blood, sweat, and tears into creating a great product and bringing in new customers. Yet most SaaS companies don’t know what they’re worth to their customers or how best to communicate value. With so many SaaS pricing models to choose from, it could easily be a case of analysis paralysis. 
Yes,nailing your pricing strategyis crucial to SaaS success—but it doesn’t have to be that difficult. Let’s take a dive into SaaS pricing: why it’s important, how to build your own kick-ass pricing strategy, and some examples of great pricing strategies and models from the real world.
![6fbdec22-d05b-416b-a870-5ac39c99ae59_Illustration_Generic_Valuation_funding_3_spotillustration](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/6fbdec22-d05b-416b-a870-5ac39c99ae59_Illustration_Generic_Valuation_funding_3_spotillustration.jpeg)
## **How is SaaS pricing different?**
In the [subscription-based pricing model](https://sbigrowth.com/insights/</insights/subscription-business-model>), customers pay on a regular basis for continued use of a service or product. This means the strategies for setting subscription prices are very different than pricing traditional products—ongoing customer payments and complex product packages mean SaaS companies need to put more thought into their pricing.
## **What's to gain from nailing your SaaS pricing?**
Most SaaS companies we come across take one of two approaches to their pricing:
  * They either set their prices on instinct when they start the business and then forget to ever take a second look.
  * Or, they’re simply too terrified of scaring away potential customers to make the changes needed to keep the business profitable and growing.


If you can get over the fear of failure, though, the benefits of nailing your SaaS pricing are worth it. You’ll not only gain a valuable advantage over your competitors (who themselves are too afraid to manage their own pricing), you’ll also unlock fresh growth and sustainability for your company.
### Gain a competitive advantage
You’re not the only company that struggles with pricing—many other SaaS companies you’re likely competing with are avoiding optimizing  _their_ pricing for all the same reasons.
By optimizing  _y_ _o_ _ur pricing_ , you’ll gain an advantage in the market—and every little bit counts, especially with all software going to $0.
### Provide true value for customers
More than anything, customers want to buy products they can easily justify; purchases they can reflect back on later and think “that was a great decision.” Finding a price your customers are eager to pay means pricing based on value instead of your business costs or competitors’ pricing models.
I’ll dig into this in more detail in a later section, but if you haven’t factored in value-based pricing on your current SaaS pricing, you might want to read this.
### Unlock an untapped growth lever
Ask any SaaS founder what growth means to them, and they’ll likely respond with “more customers.” But, it turns out monetization has a far bigger impact on the bottom line than acquisition.
In fact, our study of 512 SaaS companies showed monetization was 4x more efficient than acquisition in improving growth and 2x more efficient than efforts to improve retention.
### Strengthen your SaaS unit economics
Boiled down, SaaS success depends on the balance of two metrics: customer lifetime value (CLV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC). At its most basic, you need to make sure your CLV is substantially higher than your CAC; otherwise, you’re not going to grow.
  * It lowers your CAC through better positioning and packaging and targeting ideal customers; and
  * It increases CLV through higher prices and better retention.


The result? A stronger SaaS business, faster growth, and increased revenues.
Now you’ve seen all the benefits of optimizing your SaaS pricing, it’s time to leave the kiddie pool and dive deep into creating your own [pricing strategy](https://sbigrowth.com/insights/</pricing-consulting>) and choosing the right model for your business.
## The difference between a pricing strategy and a pricing model
First up, a quick look at the semantics. Pricing strategy and pricing model are terms that are often used interchangeably. Let's clear up what we're talking about.
Pricing strategy is the guiding processes and principles that lead you to your chosen price points, product packaging, and model. The best pricing strategy greatly depends on the market you operate in and the customers you serve.
Pricing models are the format and structure of your pricing and packaging. You can work out a company's pricing model from their pricing page, without any real insight into who they are and what they do.
## **3 popular SaaS pricing strategies**
SaaS pricing strategies run the gamut from picking numbers out of thin air at one end of the spectrum all the way to fully optimized, value-driven pricing plans at the other. Think of pricing like a game of darts: you can throw at random, or you can aim for specific points on the board, but without data to tell you where to aim, you might as well be shooting in the dark.
The reality is that pricing for maximum revenue doesn’t have to be difficult—you just need the right pricing strategy. Each of the pricing strategies below has its place for different business types, but in SaaS, the only viable option in our experience is value-based pricing.
### Cost-plus pricing
Cost-plus pricing is what people automatically think of when they think of “pricing strategy.” It’s the most basic form of pricing: add up all your costs, add a few percentage points of profit margin, and that’s where you set your prices. For a SaaS company, those costs might include things like product development and design, the company’s own SaaS providers, and the costs of the team.
Going back to our darts analogy, cost-plus pricing ensures you’ll at least be landing on the board—but anything beyond that is left to chance.
That’s where the good news ends, however. Cost-plus pricing is nowhere near the best solution for maximizing SaaS revenue since the costs for delivering a single account of a SaaS product can be very low. Your pricing should be based on the value that your customers will get out of using your product, not how much you paid your developers.
### Competitor-based pricing
Instead of using your business costs as a benchmark for your pricing, competitor-based pricing involves setting prices based on what your competitors are already charging. Depending on how well your competitors have set  _their_ pricing, competition-based pricing can get you closer to a pricing bull’s-eye—the strategy works particularly well for newer companies unsure of the value of their product and without existing sales data to back up their decisions.
Our advice? Look, but don’t touch. You want to know where your competitors are pricing their products so that you’re in the same ballpark, but they should not be guiding your decisions.
### Value-based pricing
To put it bluntly, [value-based pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/insights/</insights/value-based-pricing-wins-in-competitive-market>) is the only pricing strategy you should choose for your SaaS company. Instead of looking inwardly at your own company or laterally towards your competitors, with value-based pricing, you look outward. You look for pricing information from the people who are going to make a decision depending on your price: your customers.
  * Your pricing matches exactly what they’re willing to pay for the value you provide.
  * You can offer packages and price points that precisely meet their needs because you understand what your customers truly want.
  * You can start at a higher price point than your competitors—if you find that customers are willing to pay that price—which leads to higher revenue from the start.undefined


So what’s the downside, then? All this research takes time. Learning how willing each customer is to pay isn’t the easiest thing to do, which is why most people stick to competitor-based or cost-plus pricing. You have to be dedicated to finding out about your customers and your product to perform value-based pricing effectively.
Keep in mind, too, that even value-based pricing doesn’t give you a silver bullet. Instead, it spits out a range of prices that still forces you to make a decision on the exact price and how you package those prices for customers, leading perfectly into our next section: how should you package your SaaS pricing?
## **The 4 steps that make up a great SaaS pricing process**
Pricing is an ongoing process, a set of steps companies should keep repeating until they find a viable (and profitable) pricing strategy.
The process we follow covers four main steps: **Problem, Cause, Solution, and Implementation.**
### Problem: find the main obstacles your company is facing
The #1 question any SaaS company asks is, “What is stopping us from growing?”
It might seem like a straightforward question on the surface, but the problems range far and wide—it could be product, people, customers, or any one of a dozen other areas. The only way to find the answer is to chip away at this question, drill down into your biggest problem areas, and gaps in understanding.
SaaS companies tend to face five major problem areas when it comes to growth:
  * Poor unit economics
  * Poor user retention
  * Poor MRR retention
  * Poor acquisition volume
  * Poor conversion


Almost all of these (with the exception of acquisition volume) can be solved by improving your pricing strategy. You need to explore these areas deeper, focusing on one at a time, and collect the necessary data to define the problem. These are the things that are stopping you from succeeding and stopping your customers from succeeding with you.
### Cause: use data to discover the root cause of these issues
To find out what that underlying disease truly is, you have to go to the source: your customers.
Customers are the only people who can tell you why they don’t value your product as it stands. Unfortunately, the vast majority of SaaS companies usually avoid this step for three main reasons:
  * It takes time.
  * They’re scared of what they’ll find out.
  * They think they already have the answers.


By asking the right questions of your customers and adding the right data to your buyer personas, you can find out more about where your company is succeeding and where it is failing than you ever would looking at an analytics dashboard.
I won’t beat around the bush—it takes hard work. You’ll no doubt hear things you don’t like, and you’ll need to face the harsh reality of your current pricing strategy.
But all of this is data that makes your company better and moves you up and to the right.
### Solution: use data-driven experiments to test viable solutions
This is the fun (and also the scary) part. Running tests and gathering data to validate or invalidate your hypotheses are vital for identifying the best long-term pricing strategy that you can.
By testing small changes often, you can quickly get reliable data on each of your individual hypothesis. You can see what works and what doesn’t, and only take the time and effort to permanently implement the changes that maximize growth and revenue.
### Implementation: put into action the best solutions
This is where you take the results from your experimentation and embed them into your pricing.
This is the entire point of your pricing process, though also the part that companies rarely follow up on. Going live with major pricing changes is terrifying for any SaaS company. Will customers recoil at the new prices? Will acquisition drop off a cliff?
With quantified buyer personas, though, you can make these changes confidently, safe in the knowledge that the value you provide aligns with what the customers want and what they are willing to pay.
Now you understand the process for developing your pricing, let’s take a look at a few strategies you can use to determine how much you should be charging.
## The most popular SaaS pricing models
There are dozens of ways to price your SaaS product, but most companies tend to follow a handful of popular pricing models. Here are seven SaaS pricing models most commonly used:
  1. Flat-rate pricing 
  2. Usage-based pricing 
  3. Tiered pricing
  4. Per-user pricing
  5. Per-active-user pricing 
  6. Per-feature pricing
  7. Freemium pricing 


Let’s look at each one in turn.
## 1. Flat-rate pricing
### What is flat-rate pricing? 
This model is the simplest approach to selling SaaS. You offer one product at one price, with the same set of features – and that’s it. Customers get the choice between paying monthly or paying annually, often with a discount available for annual subscriptions. 
### Pros of flat-rate pricing 
  * Easy to communicate value – flat-rate pricing is easy for potential customers to understand. They don't need to struggle to decide which option. That also makes it more comfortable for you to sell.
  * More focused – with just one product, you can focus all your sales and marketing efforts on it, and build clearly-defined funnels.


### Cons of flat-rate pricing 
  * Limits customer diversity – for example, a product priced for enterprise buyers will likely be too expensive for small businesses. Finding the sweet spot for pricing can be tricky.
  * Missing out on potential revenue streams – With just one price, it’s hard to up-sell when existing customers want more services
  * Lack of nuance – potential customers either want it, or they don’t. You don't have much scope for persuading them.


### Who is flat-rate pricing a good fit for?
Flat-rate pricing could work for your business if you offer either a simple product with a limited feature set, or a consumer-focused subscription product.
### Flat-rate pricing in action
Project management software provider Basecamp offers a flat-rate pricing model targeting people working in teams online.
Basecamp charges a flat rate of $99 a month for 500 GB of storage, unlimited projects, unlimited users, and no per-user fees.
![44c9f2e9-7370-404b-af60-1ea94458a479_Basecamp+pricing+page](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/44c9f2e9-7370-404b-af60-1ea94458a479_Basecamp%2Bpricing%2Bpage.jpeg)
## 2. Usage-based pricing
### What is usage-based pricing?
With this model, the cost of the product relates directly to how much a customer uses it. If they use more, the price goes up. If they use less, the price goes down.
[Usage-based](https://sbigrowth.com/insights/</insights/usage-based-pricing>) pricingis common among infrastructure software companies (like Amazon Web Services or Digital Ocean), which charge users based on things like the number of gigabytes of data they use, or how many API requests they make.
### Pros of usage-based pricing
  * **Customizable** – Appeals to a wide range of customers with different needs
  * **Transparent** – The model gives the customer the responsibility for managing their usage
  * **Lower bar to entry** – Easier to attract new clients because the price is not the main deciding factor


### Cons of usage-based pricing 
  * **Unpredictable revenue** – this model tends to attract customers with volatile use patterns, making it harder for you to predict and manage your revenue from one month to the next
  * **Growth depends on customers** – your own growth is closely tied to that of your customers. You can only scale if their businesses grow, leading to them spending more money on your service


### Who is usage-based pricing a good fit for?
It's great if your customers have volatile demand in their businesses, as you can tailor your pricing to match that demand. 
This is especially attractive for smaller start-ups, as it gives them the option to use the same products as enterprise companies, at an affordable price point.
### Usage-based pricing in action
Twilio is a cross-platform communication tool. It offers a choice of messaging in SMS, voice, video, WhatsApp, email, and more. Twilio offers users a small number of free credits to get started, then charges them by the number of messages they use.
![f3f00cd8-4403-4cd4-8832-213313a673a6_Twilio+pricing+page](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/f3f00cd8-4403-4cd4-8832-213313a673a6_Twilio%2Bpricing%2Bpage.jpeg)
## 3. Tiered pricing
### What is tiered pricing?
Tiered pricing tends to be the best pricing model for most SaaS companies, and the one we most often recommend. It's the model used by companies like HubSpot and Slack.
The tiered pricing model lets SaaS companies offer two or more packages or fixed sets of features for a specific price. Each tier can be tailored to meet the specific needs of a particular buyer persona—for example, beginner users versus enterprise—with tier prices increasing as you provide more value.
### Pros of tiered pricing
  * **Maximizes revenue** – better persona targeting leads to higher conversions and maximum revenue 
  * **Broader appeal** – using multiple packages lets you appeal to a wider range of potential customers – individuals, small businesses, and enterprise clients – hence boosting your revenue potential
  * **Easy upselling** – the customer has an obvious route to the next level, once they outgrow their current tier. This helps boost your customer lifetime value and enhances customer loyalty. 


### Cons of tiered pricing
  * **Risk of overwhelm** – too many options can confuse potential customers and lead to abandoned sales. It's usually best to stick with just three price tiers.
  * **Loss of focus** – Creating too many packages with too many features can cause you to lose focus on your core target audience
  * **Deep audience research needed** – this is key to make sure you combine the different features in the best way for the target audience. But it can consume a lot of time and effort.


### Who is tiered pricing a good fit for?
If your business sells licenses, seats, or similar, then tiered pricing could be the best SaaS pricing model for you. 
### Tiered pricing in action
Zapier is a tool that helps users automate commonly repeated tasks. They use a pricing model structured around five tiers, ranging from ‘Free’ (zero cost) at the bottom to ‘Company’ (599 USD per month) at the top.
![f8df8552-1179-4d3f-b00b-e8bb2cb5d4d2_Zapier+pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/f8df8552-1179-4d3f-b00b-e8bb2cb5d4d2_Zapier%2Bpricing.jpeg)
## 4. Per-user pricing
### What is per-user pricing?
[Per-user pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/insights/</insights/per-user-pricing>) is another one of the most popular pricing models currently used in the SaaS industry. It's popular because of its simplicity – a fixed monthly price for one user, double that price for a second user, and triple for a third. 
Your customers can easily understand what they get for their money, and your SaaS company benefits from having predictable monthly revenue. 
### Pros of per-user pricing
  * **Simplicity** – both for your customers and for your business
  * **Predictable revenue** – with per-user pricing, you can easilyforecast your revenuefor each month
  * **Adoption is rewarded** – your revenue is directly tied to user adoption, so increase your users and you'll also increase your revenue.


### Cons of per-user pricing
  * **Users may cheat** – per user pricing allows users to share logins with others, which means you lose out on additional revenue
  * **Limits number of users per organization** – in order to save money on additional users, companies who buy your product will be careful how many licenses they buy
  * **Hard to communicate value** – with per-user pricing, it’s harder for customers to see real value in adding another user


### Who is per-user pricing a good fit for?
It's great for SaaS companies who rely heavily on a recurring revenue model because per-user pricing makes it really easy to predict your MRR.
### Per-user pricing in action
The online graphic design tool Canva offers a per-user option among its other pricing options. For $30 per user per month, this includes all features from the Pro model, with access for every user on a team.
![0fbf0105-ecd6-49c1-935d-9a69a0faeff8_Canva+pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/0fbf0105-ecd6-49c1-935d-9a69a0faeff8_Canva%2Bpricing.jpeg)
### What isper-active-user pricing?
This is where you charge customers based on how active they are. It doesn't matter how many users are enrolled, you’ll only charge the customer based on the ones who actually use your product. Typically, this means charging for users who have logged in during the last 30 days.
### Pros of the per-active-user model
  * Customers don't have to waste money on inactive users.
  * Easier decision for enterprise companies to roll out your product company-wide – as they only pay if it works.


### Cons of the per-active-user model
  * Bad fit for small businesses as it doesn't give much incentive when teams are small.
  * Can be more complicated when compared to per-user pricing – especially in how to define ‘active user’ 
  * It doesn’t fit well with annual price plans, as customers can perceive it as wasteful if the service does not get much use.


### Who is per-active-user pricing a good fit for?
If you’ve had problems convincing customers to onboard with your per-user model, then a shift to the less risky per-active user pricing model could spur them to take the leap. 
### Per-active-user pricing in action
Cloud-based messaging platform Slack is a well-known example of a SaaS company succeeding with the per-active-user pricing model.
![5c9b8a51-ee8c-4ae4-a8f6-58577213bb25_Slack+pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/5c9b8a51-ee8c-4ae4-a8f6-58577213bb25_Slack%2Bpricing.jpeg)
## 6. Per-feature pricing
### What is per-feature pricing
Users aren't the only variable used to determine SaaS pricing models. As the name suggests, the per feature pricing model uses features to determine price. 
Typically, this involves creating different packages and listing all the features contained in each one. Customers pay more when they need more features.
Common package names could be Standard, Pro, Advanced, or similar.
### Pros of per-feature pricing
  * **Aids upsell** – Provides a strong incentive for customers to upgrade to the next level, in order to access more features
  * **Clear package differentiation** – Allows you to deliver high resource features as part of your top tier packages


### Cons of per-feature pricing
  * **Customer frustration** – More potential for dissatisfied customers, because they're missing out on some functionality despite paying the fee 
  * **Research intensive to get right** – Can be challenging to decide which features to include in each package – needs detailed research to know what each type of customer wants


### Who is per-feature pricing a good fit for?
Per-feature pricing is a versatile model. But it works best for SaaS businesses that have taken the time to clearly map each set of features to a specific customer persona. If all your features are a great fit for all customers, you’ll lose out on the benefits of the per-feature pricing model. 
### Per-feature pricing in action
Note-taking tool Evernote offers Basic, Plus, and Premium plans, with different features unlocked at each level.
![bc60f225-81ca-4272-a6e2-af58854626eb_Evernote+pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/bc60f225-81ca-4272-a6e2-af58854626eb_Evernote%2Bpricing.jpeg)
## 7. Freemium pricing
### What is freemium pricing?
This one is normally used as a gateway to additional paid packages. The freemium tier represents the entry-level, with users regularly incentivized to upgrade to a paid tier.
For example, you might have a pop-up box when they try to use a feature that's not available in the freemium tier. Evernote uses this approach.
The free tier usually has limitations on features, capacity, or types of use cases.
### Pros of the freemium pricing model 
  * **Reduced barrier to adoption** – users love to try a new service without having to first enter their credit card details.
  * **Build a large customer database** – freemium users can be a great source of emails for your list, to help you build relationships with them going forward
  * **Product validation** – Great way to test new features on different customer personas


### Cons of the freemium pricing model
  * **Risk of resource drain –** constantly serving freemium users can be an unnecessary drain on your resources, with no revenue to show for it.
  * **Difficult to establish value** – people love getting free things and may sometimes prefer to stick to freemium forever. 


### Who is the freemium pricing model a good fit for?
It's great for new SaaS businesses that need to raise awareness of their product. An excellent free tool can quickly go viral on social media, leading to widespread buzz and more chances of paid signups. 
### Freemium pricing in action
MailChimp is a popular email marketing platform with a generous freemium offering. Users can get started easily, with enough free functionality to get them up and running. Once their email list grows beyond 2000 subscribers, they can upgrade to the first paid tier to access more features. 
![ce1f4627-4e56-45f4-a0cb-4fe2601eefaa_Mailchimp+pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/ce1f4627-4e56-45f4-a0cb-4fe2601eefaa_Mailchimp%2Bpricing.jpeg)
## **4 successful companies that crushed their SaaS pricing strategies**
You might be tempted to ask which pricing model is the best, but there’s no silver bullet here. Different pricing models work best for different companies and different customer types—it’s only through following your pricing process and analyzing customer data that you can uncover the best pricing model for your company.
To help you out, let’s take a look at four different companies that are crushing it with their pricing strategies—you’ll no doubt find some inspiration you can apply to your own pricing.
### Slack
Now, Slack combines two different pricing models, charging per seat but also giving customers multiple tiers to choose from. New buyers have a choice of three tiers, and each tier unlocks additional functionality:
  * The Free plan includes unlimited seats but restricts message history and the number of integrations.
  * The Standard plan lifts the restrictions on message history and integrations but excludes enterprise services like single sign-on.
  * The Plus plan gives enterprise customers the whole shebang for the highest price.


![c1369a6b-6bda-41a5-8bd4-26a4235661d6_slack+pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/c1369a6b-6bda-41a5-8bd4-26a4235661d6_slack%2Bpricing.jpeg)
Likewise, Slack also knows that for larger teams—say, 50 to 100 people—enterprise features like single sign-on and compliance reports become essential, which Slack provides through their Plus tier.
You can read more about Slack’s “holy grail” of SaaS pricing in our [Pricing Page Teardown](https://sbigrowth.com/insights/</insights/slack-pricing-page-teardown>)—it’s one of the strongest pricing strategies we've come across.
### Hubspot
Aligning your pricing tiers with your value metric isn’t the only thing to consider when setting your pricing—you should also try to align your pricing tiers with buyer personas, something HubSpot nails with their pricing strategy.
![e79dee4e-7169-4717-b821-bb9f35a7ce0a_hubspot+pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/e79dee4e-7169-4717-b821-bb9f35a7ce0a_hubspot%2Bpricing.jpeg)
Check out more on [HubSpot's pricing strategy](https://sbigrowth.com/insights/</insights/hubspot-pricing-teardown>) in our Pricing Page Teardown.
### G Suite
Like Slack, Google's G Suite product intentionally keeps its pricing straightforward and easy to digest.
![a75eb139-2af0-4c91-a23b-1c3887c121f6_G+suite+pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/a75eb139-2af0-4c91-a23b-1c3887c121f6_G%2Bsuite%2Bpricing.jpeg)
Google’s tandem approach of per-seat pricing and value-based tiers makes sense, given their target market. Keeping prices affordable helps boost acquisition and lock in customers, with plenty of options for expansion as companies (and their business needs) continue to grow.
### Zendesk
Sitting at the opposite end of the spectrum from Google, Zendesk’s suite of customer experience products offers up a range of challenges around pricing.
![67b29e8c-1ea9-4519-acff-8534cd0dbc25_Zendesk+pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/hubfs/67b29e8c-1ea9-4519-acff-8534cd0dbc25_Zendesk%2Bpricing.jpeg)

## **How to change your SaaS pricing model**
In a fast-changing space like SaaS, customer needs, competitor offerings, and technology itself are constantly evolving. Customers switch easily from one product to another. Your pricing approach needs to reflect the speed of these changes. You need to regularly re-evaluate your pricing approach and make changes, ideallyevery six months.
Here are some signs it's time to shake it up:
  * **It's been a while.** This one goes without saying – if you haven't changed your prices since you launched, then you’ll probably need to catch up with your competition.
  * **Customers don't negotiate.** If customers happily pay your prices without a murmur, you should probably raise those prices. If customers keep telling you what a great bargain they're getting, even more so.
  * **You’ve added new features.** If you’ve added new features to your offering, it's time to update the price to reflect that. Otherwise, you risk wasting the time and energy involved in developing those features.
  * **You can prove you give great ROI.** If your offering provides an especially high level of value to your customers, then make sure you price it with that in mind.


Be gentle with existing customers when it comes to big price increases. Instead, consider offering legacy rates for a time in recognition of their early adoption, or raising your new rates gradually over time. 
There will always be some customers who won't be happy about a price hike. To handle this, prepare a clear and honest response explaining the decision from the perspective of the value your products bring.
If you're feeling extra cautious, you could try testing new pricing models with a smaller segment of your existing customers, rather than everyone at the same time. 
No matter which pricing approach you decide to take, always keep in mind your unique relationship with your customers and be guided by what makes the most sense for them.

## **Your pricing is too important to neglect**
Whether you’re a large or small SaaS business, it never hurts to take a second look at pricing. If you haven't ever optimized your product/service’s pricing for your target/current customer base, you have room to grow.
If you take only three things away from this guide, remember these key pricing points:
  * **Always,_always_ charge based on value **- no excuses. It’s far and away the optimum strategy for SaaS companies.
  * **Target the right buyers.** Make sure your pricing tiers line up with your ideal customers.
  * **Don’t complicate things.** Keep your pricing structure simple for better acquisition.
