According to a 2020 study, companies spend 50% more now on SaaS products than they did the year before. Also, the number of unique apps that SaaS companies are using has increased by about 30%.
The data shows that the demand is increasing, which is excellent news, but the market is becoming more and more competitive. Buyers have more options than ever, and B2B SaaS companies need to put in more effort to stand out.
This article will take you through sixteen SaaS marketing plans and tactics that any B2B SaaS company should consider in 2022.
But first, let’s quickly look at the definition of B2B SaaS marketing.
## What is B2B SaaS Marketing: Definition
Considering that SaaS stands for “software as a service,” it means that SaaS marketing involves promoting software based on subscriptions.
A solid [B2B SaaS marketing agency](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/www.webdew.com/blog/saas-marketing-agency>) strategy brings the product to the right audience at the right time and emphasizes how the product brings value to the customer.
In this crowded market, buyers explore and evaluate many options before making a purchasing decision. Google calls this stage in the buyer’s journey the “messy middle”. That’s where you want to focus your B2B SaaS marketing plans and efforts. 
If your organization can take the time to consider this new way people buy [SaaS products](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/spdload.com/blog/what-is-saas-product/>), you’ll have a better grip on your marketing tactics as a whole.
## How Can You Create an Effective B2B SaaS Marketing Strategy?
Before discussing the B2B SaaS marketing strategies to employ, let’s have a quick look at how you can create those effective strategies tailored to your business and requirements.
### Assign Goals to Your B2B SaaS Marketing
Creating aimless SaaS strategies without a specific goal in mind is nothing short of wandering on the road – it leads to no destination.
So, before you make marketing strategies your priority, you need to add a goal to the top of your list. 
What will your strategies aim to accomplish? 
Is it to acquire more leads, boost brand awareness, or align your marketing and B2B SaaS sales strategy and technique?
The goal shouldn’t be abstract either. For example, simply generating more leads is not enough; you should clearly know how many leads you aim to acquire. Developing effective SaaS B2B marketing strategies will become easier if you have detailed goals. 
Start with setting **SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timed) goals for your strategies** , and the following steps will fall in line naturally.
### Draft a Budget
If creating marketing strategies was only about creativity, then the sky would be the limit; but it’s not so, unfortunately. You need to think of a realistic budget to assign to your marketing campaigns and strategies.
If you allocate a reasonable budget beforehand, you won’t waste time thinking of strategies you can’t implement successfully. 
Now, the question is, “** _how much of your revenue should you allocate to marketing B2B SaaS products_?**”
Generally, **medium-sized or large businesses like Salesforce allocate[40-50% of their annual revenue](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/s23.q4cdn.com/574569502/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/Salesforce-FY-2020-Annual-Report.pdf>).**
But, it’s not all you are supposed to do. Drafting a budget comprises allocating funds and distributing them for different SaaS strategies. It is about managing funds in case of unforeseen costs and what tactics are worth spending more for your business. 
### Develop Marketing Tactics
Once the budget is set, you can now think about what you need to do to achieve the goals you have set. You can follow a few points to effectively design and implement your B2B SaaS marketing strategies. 
  * Understand your audience: It’s impossible to design successful B2B marketing strategies for SaaS businesses if you don’t know your target audience. It’s all the more critical now since personalized marketing is highly prevalent. 


You cannot convince people to become your customers if you are convincing them the wrong way. If you know who you want to target, you’ll be able to crack the “How” part, and that’s how you create successful marketing strategies.
  * Re-evaluate your current strategies: Before brainstorming for new strategies and engaging your resources in the process, it’s wise to re-evaluate your current SaaS strategies and rule out the ones not working. This way, you will clearly understand what has worked for you in the past and what direction to follow.


## How Do SaaS Companies Stand Out From the Competition?
Every market is full of cut-throat competition, and SaaS is no different. Companies still make it to the top tier level to bag customers and profits alike with just the right strategies. 
So, let’s cover what SaaS companies do to make the potential prospects notice them and turn them into customers.
### 1. Devise a UI/UX Strategy
One of the key strategies globally successful businesses use is influencing consumer behavior in your favor. One way to do this is to prepare effective user experience (UX) strategies with an intuitive and interactive user interface (UI). 
Providing user satisfaction involves creating a seamless and positive experience for your customers/users, from your website, [mobile app](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/qualaroo.com/blog/mobile-app-survey-guide/>), to software products. 
You need to ensure that the user interface of your website or mobile app and your software product is efficient. Thus, developing these well-defined strategies will help you focus on these main points. 
One way to go about it is [pop-up surveys](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/qualaroo.com/blog/best-exit-intent-pop-up-tools/>). UX designers can use surveys to [gather in-context feedback](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/qualaroo.com/blog/how-to-gather-feedback-without-distracting-the-customer-experience/>) from website visitors or users and put the finger on what needs improvement.
![ pop-up surveys.](https://qualaroo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pop-up-surveys..png)
They can place surveys in prototypes or any specific pages of a website to minimize usability issues by asking users about their experience and what they think is working or not.
```

```

Here are some examples of survey questions that you can ask to gather contextual feedback:

### 2. Find What Makes You Unique
Generally, products are the main components that set a company apart from the competition. The better the product, the better your business will perform than the competitors. 
To create robust products and undefeatable SaaS strategies, many companies use on-site surveys to collect user feedback and gauge what features/updates customers want to add/remove from the product to create a customer-centric experience and boost satisfaction for your products. Here is an example:
![collect customer feedback](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
Besides this parameter, other factors can make your SaaS unique and stand out from the competition. Some pointers which you should consider to stand out are:
  * Offer better customer-centric services and support 
  * Focus on different and diverse audiences and segments 
  * Ensure seamless UI and UX across all channels, platforms, and departments
  * Create less frictional flows in the user journey


### 3. Plan a Long-Term Business Model
[Create a website](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/cybernews.com/best-website-builders/>) to convey your vision, mission, and goals. Establish a robust digital presence for your business and connect better with your customers.
There are many “standard” business models for SaaS startups to try. One of the popular ones is venture capital. Many startups from the onset rely on venture capital, while others start slowly, both keeping the long-term benefits in mind. These are the two options that create a base for the business model. 
To further ensure you build a long-term business model, you need to keep improving your conversion rate and bringing in more business. You can use the customer feedback you collect to identify areas of improvement and re-evaluate your value proposition, pricing, and other crucial elements.
You can also use the feedback to:
Run A/B testing for your website ⇒ Check the Net Promoter Score (NPS as shown below) using the feedback surveys ⇒ Redefine your SaaS B2B marketing strategies.
![NPS Formula](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
All in all, a long-term business model is only possible as long as you stay relevant and focused on your customers’ needs.

### 4. Focus on Value Instead of Cost in Competition
One of the most common and rookie mistakes SaaS startups make is considering the cost as their competitive advantage. Sure, it is in e-commerce or other industries, but SaaS is different. Here, the customers’ primary goal is to find a product that works and has lower costs and discounts.
If your product does not have value for customers, it will never become a hit, no matter how competitive your prices are. But, if it performs well and has value for customers, then they will pay reasonably. 
Additionally, price is not a stable competitive advantage, as you only have the upper hand until someone else comes with even lower prices. It results in pricing wars, where your margins get sliver to the point; it’s not sustainable for your business in the longer run.
Now, let’s dive into the fundamental tactics any B2B SaaS company should consider to grow its business.
## 16 Proven B2B Saas Marketing Strategies to Grow Your Business
With everything else out of the way, we can finally look at the time-tested B2B marketing strategies for SaaS you can apply for your business.
### 1. Quality Content for the Win
Saying that content can make or break your marketing won’t be overstating it. Creating and putting out quality content establishes you as an industry thought leader, naturally boosting your brand image. 
Content, such as blog posts, case studies, books, whitepapers, podcasts, social media posts, etc., makes for a great B2B marketing strategy. Such content allows your brand to reach your targeted audience, introduce them to your company’s mission and services and boost recognition. 
It is crucial to understand that we don’t mean over-the-top promotional articles and posts when we say content. Quality content is education and helps your customers learn something they are interested in, which is helpful to them.
Take Neil Patel, for example; you can access several courses and guides for free and expand your knowledge on digital marketing without actually becoming a customer. 
![](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
Similarly, Qualaroo shares insightful content to create a delightful customer experience. For example, you can find [guides](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/qualaroo.com/guides/>) and [educational videos](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/www.youtube.com/user/Qualaroo>) to understand how to listen to your customers’ feedback.
### 2. Work on Social Media Presence
Any smart organization knows the importance of having an online presence on social media and what it can do for your business. 
It is the single most effective strategy nowadays to connect to your customers on a personal level and foster a loyal relationship. Constant interaction with your audience keeps you in their minds, having a more lasting impression than any ad campaign. 
Many SaaS companies took a page from Elon Musk’s book of relationship-building and now interact with customers on social platforms.
For example, Adobe interacts regularly with its customers to give them extra information on products and pricing or troubleshoot whenever customers reach out to them with issues.
![](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
And here’s another example of how it’s done on Twitter:
https://twitter.com/MarketoCares/status/673997495840677889 
Platforms such as [Instagram](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/www.instagram.com/?hl=en>), [LinkedIn](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/www.linkedin.com/signup>), [Twitter](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/twitter.com/login?lang=en>), and [Facebook](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/www.facebook.com/>) overflow with brands interacting with their customers and building a solid [social media presence](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/www.businessinsuranceusa.com/news/employment/why-your-social-media-presence-matters-when-job-hunting/>). So, as a SaaS brand, you should get on this bandwagon and see the magic happen.
### 3. Keep the Community Alive
**_With a great social media presence comes great responsibility to sustain the community._**
If you play your cards right, followers will be pouring in on your social media. The next natural step is to keep them engaged with informative content and keep the community alive. 
Companies invest in online webinars and create forums or groups on social media to educate and engage customers. It is a way to entertain the audience while listening to and resolving their issues.
### 4. Promote Testimonials and Partnerships on Major Places
Customer testimonials & partnerships are a testament to your credibility and that customers can trust your products & services. 
Even as customers, we tend to look at the brand, its online presence, and customer reviews before making a purchase. People trust people and their experiences more than any marketing campaign. 
So, why not use this valuable resource and turn it into your portfolio of loyal customers and their trust in your brand?
You can access customer testimonials from forums, comments on your social media post, and [customer feedback tools](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/qualaroo.com/blog/best-customer-feedback-tools/>) that capture your customers’ verbatim feedback. 
For example, [Qualaroo](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/qualaroo.com/>) is a survey tool that allows you to create surveys and capture customer responses. You can use these responses as testimonials on your website, as shown below.
![](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
Also, you should showcase your top-tier customers on your website homepage to induce trust in customers.
![](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
### 5. Devise a Referral Program
Besides using the power of social media, you can employ another B2B marketing strategy simultaneously – A referral program. 
Referral programs play on the phenomenon that people prefer to purchase a product when recommended by someone they know and trust. An effective referral program will help you acquire more leads, boost your sign-ups, and bring in a targeted audience.
In return, you offer some benefits to both referring and the referred customers. For example, [Trello](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/trello.com/en>), a project collaboration platform, uses a referral program where customers get a free month of _Trello Gold_ if they refer to one person. 
So, if a customer refers to 12 people, they can enjoy a whole year of Trello Gold. Not only did Trello increase its customer base this way, but also spread awareness about its premium plan.
### 6. Introduce a Variety of Pricing Plans
More often than not, customers are not satisfied with the pricing and may ask for more personalized plans. Especially for a SaaS business, it’s crucial to listen to its customers and cater to businesses of all sizes to expand their horizons. 
Different pricing plans allow customers to choose the one they see fit and can afford. Doing so lets customers know you are aware of their limitations and needs and proactively deliver on these fronts.
### 7. Video Marketing Is the New Black
[Video marketing](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/lovo.ai/post/12-video-marketing-trends-to-look-out-for-in-2024>) has taken social media by storm, and it’s everywhere. People have started to consume more content, and brands have stepped up to incorporate this customer need into their B2B marketing strategy.
You can use your video content in multiple ways and market it to relevant audiences to generate more leads while educating your existing customers. 
For example, Neil Patel publishes his videos on social media and interacts with the comments, ensuring to engage more and more audience. 
![](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
### 8. Keep SEO a Priority
Search engine optimization (SEO) is a marketing strategy that focuses on driving organic leads to your website by ensuring your website ranks higher on search engines. It’s true that SEO includes adding high-performing keywords to your content, but it’s broader than this. 
An [effective SEO strategy](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/outreachmonks.com/seo-roadmap/>) will drive leads to your sales funnel without needing the help of Google ads. 
It focuses on your whole website, like how well it is designed as per Google, the primary keywords for your target audience, and natural backlinking to improve your website’s DA (Domain Authority). 
Once you know the right keywords to target, you can optimize your website for the Google search engine to rank in the top spots, increasing your brand visibility. 
You can conduct [A/B testing](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/qualaroo.com/ab-testing/>) to improve your website’s performance and align your content marketing with your SEO strategy.

### 9. Improve Your PPC Campaigns
Pay-per-click or PPC advertising is one of the most popular [B2B SaaS marketing](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/visiner.com/>) tactics. Even for companies that do well on the SEO front, PPC is still something they invest in because of the level of control it gives you. 
![](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
Plus, paid search costs less than half of the amount spent on a traditional ad published elsewhere.
With that said, some best performing paid ads have a few things in common:
  * They start with a general benefit but also make a specific promise
  * They address a pain point 
  * They show you the way you’ll benefit from their product


Remember that your SEO strategy should partially support your PPC campaign. For example, your strategy should achieve a top rank for the PPC keywords or phrases you are targeting. 
You should also pay attention to the ad quality score, i.e., make sure you offer some value through those ads and not just mention your landing pages and home page. 
### 10. Leverage SaaS-Centric Review Portals
Specifically, in the case of SaaS businesses, whenever you search a related keyword, the first few results are always from forums and review sites. For example, if you search the keywords, the first three results are of such websites, as shown in the image. 
![](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
It clearly shows that these websites are essential for leads, and they do check out your company and look for customer reviews. In this case, it’s wise to have your company represented on these websites accurately. 
You can reach out to websites like Capterra, G2, Crows Reviews, Software Suggest, Clutch, etc., and have your company listed there. If this hasn’t been a part of your SaaS marketing strategy, you are missing out big time and should do it ASAP.
### 11. Make SaaS Sign-Ups Snappy
No one likes lengthy sign-ups that take forever to complete. For customers, their time is essential. A few seconds make or break the customer experience. And surely, you don’t want to blow it just because you added a question or two that take a few more seconds.
So, it’s better to keep the signup process crisp even if you are offering a free trial. Carefully analyze your signup process and remove any steps that feel unnecessary and forced.
**Here’s an in-house example of how live chat tool**[**ProProfs** **Chat**](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/www.proprofschat.com/>)**increased sign-ups by almost 30% by tweaking its sign-up page.**
ProProfs Chat saw a massive drop-off of prospects after they were landing on the sign-up page. Not many visitors who clicked on the sign-up CTA button got through the process since the sign-up form was too long. 
Using [Qualaroo Nudges](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/help.qualaroo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020572012-What-is-the-Qualaroo-Nudge->) and Microsoft [Clarity](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/clarity.microsoft.com/session-recordings/>)’s Session Recording feature, ProProfs Chat overhauled its sign-up form to make it crisper and made the process step-by-step & conversational to see almost a 30% increase in monthly signups.
### 12. Improvise Call-to-Action
A critical step in your content marketing strategy is a call-to-action at the end of every content. 
![](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
The whole purpose of creating content is to bring leads closer to becoming a customer. Achieving this goal will not be possible if you don’t give them a goal or action after engaging with your content. 
It is why placing CTAs at crucial touchpoints throughout the customer journey is pivotal to expanding your sales funnel.
### 13. Give in-App Product Tours 
SaaS customer acquisition and retention are tightly related to the product’s perceived value. If customers manage to make the most out of the tools you provide, they’ll likely convert more, stay longer and even recommend your product to their peers. 
One of the best ways to make sure your product is well understood is to give product tours. According to Invisionapp, a product tour can help improve B2B SaaS sales conversions by at least 20%.
When should I give a product tour?
Ideally, give the product tour as soon as possible when users sign up and first interact with your product. You can also engage existing customers with short tours of new features. 
For example, project management tool Teamwork shows new users their progress with the features available, how many features they used, and how many are still to be discovered. Every feature comes with a short video tutorial and links to a knowledge base to help you learn more.
If you’re looking for a tool to help you set up a step-by-step product tour, you can try Stonly or Intercom.

### 14. Start an Affiliate Program
An affiliate program is something B2C brands have been using for a long time to boost their sales. More and more B2B SaaS brands have started adopting this channel to reach new audiences using bloggers and social media influencers.
How to Search Online for Companies That Run Affiliate Programs
If you’re looking for examples of companies that [run Affiliate programs](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/uppromote.com/blog/create-an-affiliate-program/>), use advanced search operators like these to spot dedicated pages:
  * intitle:” affiliate program”
  * Intitle:” referral commissions”
  * Inurl:affiliates 


Affise, Impact, and Voluum are just a few examples of [affiliate tracking software](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/venturz.co/comparisons/best-affiliate-tracking-software>) you might consider if you’re starting with an affiliate program.
### 15. Make It Easy for Prospects to Book Calls & Demos
If you’re looking to convert your content leads into actual marketing qualified leads, then make it easy for them to either [book a call or a demo](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/www.storylane.io/blog/ways-to-increase-demo-bookings>) with your team. For that, it’s essential to pay attention to the way you [design your landing page](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/<https:/dorik.com/blog/how-to-create-a-landing-page>):
  * Reduce the number of form fields
  * Include social proof such as video testimonials or quotes for customers 
  * Consider adding a short video demo


For example, Qualaroo makes it easy for prospects to book a demo call whenever it suits their calendar:

### 16. Curate Reviews and Customer Feedback Along with Success Stories
Irrespective of how intuitive the UI of your product is or how feature-rich it is, users would never know about it before trying, which is only possible when they purchase subscription plans or sign up for a trial. But there is another way – customer reviews and testimonials.
How Can a Company Motivate Its Potential Users to Try Their Product? 
For starters, you need to develop trust in them towards your products, and the best way to do this is to show them what other customers think of and experience with your product. Now, acquiring honest and detailed reviews and testimonials is easier said than done. 
So, for this purpose, many companies deploy survey tools like Qualaroo and ProProfs Survey Maker to gather customer feedback about their products and services and extract reviews and testimonials worthy information. 
And the best part?
You can get contextual feedback that is richer and more meaningful than just a general survey. You can strategically place surveys with specific triggers to collect in-context feedback and gain an in-depth view of user experience.
Features like sentiment analysis in such survey tools help you skim through tons of feedback and select the most helpful information to use as success stories and reviews for potential clients as proof.
![](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
Such survey and analytics tools use the “word cloud” feature to access the verbatim responses of users and highlight the frequently used vocabulary in the feedback. You can select any word from the word cloud and select the reviews best representing your business as powerful testimonials.
![](https://qualaroo.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/)
Besides Sentiment Analysis, you can also collect contextual insights from existing customers using exit-intent survey pop-ups. Some tools let you place exit-intent surveys that appear correct when the visitors leave the website to ask them what went wrong and how you can improve their experience.

Let’s dive in!
## Why Are SaaS Growth Strategies So Important for Your Business?
A **SaaS growth strategy is a combination of promotional activities and tactics** designed to help you increase customer acquisition and improve retention.
Growth strategies are important for your SaaS business because they help you to:
[**Acquire and retain customers**](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.getscrapbook.com/>)- by understanding your target audience, and their pain points and providing solutions that address their specific needs, you can build trust, increase customer satisfaction, and foster long-term relationships.
**Expand your market** - By identifying untapped markets and niche industries, SaaS providers can tailor their offerings and enter new territories. With a well-executed strategy, it is much easier to do it.
**Stay ahead of the competition** - An effective growth strategy includes monitoring competitors, understanding market dynamics, and adapting quickly to changes to maintain a competitive edge.
**Facilitate scalability and sustainable growth** - A well-designed growth strategy enables you to manage growth effectively, allocate resources wisely, and achieve long-term profitability.
These strategies are essential for SaaS businesses as they **provide a way to create new growth opportunities quickly and with low amounts of resources.**
So let’s go through some of the interesting ones you can implement.
## 8 Effective SaaS Growth Strategies You Should Implement in 2024
### 1. Meet Your Audience and Develop ICP
**Meeting and understanding your target audience** is essential before you start implementing any of the SaaS growth strategies. 
Without knowing your audience, you’ll just aimlessly wander in the dark, wasting money.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/64883b8c548233cfc9d5a236_e6tvbr6YwAe8w_6ABkpSGBQ38QJRiEGNQjpa4BgaPLJuAm8yv0ohibarj5m_DKzoTr6Pb0tM2hNPSJ1n2FUE6pqsgEJcwIgwOUTP_12dzzEsNtk4bPpSTceESO7VPx-o36Qd05tVv7VfD-UpsXouR4E.gif)
On the contrary, knowing who your audience is**will help you create a product that satisfies them** and know how to speak with them. 
So, how to meet your audience and develop an **ICP(Ideal Customer Persona)**?
**Step 1. Start by researching current and potential customers** by asking questions:
  * What age range do they fall in? 
  * Are they male or female? 
  * Where do most of them live? 
  * How much money do they have available for purchasing your product?


![how-to-define-your-target-audience](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/66e8a09b92a32dad74ad3bd3_64883d68a260ab6db2319b13_how-to-define-your-target-audience.png)
**Use customer surveys, social media polls, and other methods to determine** your customer's needs and preferences by asking questions such as:
  * Who is already using your product?
  * What do they like about it? 
  * What would they want to see improved? 


If you already have some users, don’t forget to create the survey for them too.
They will give you so much valuable information.
**Note:** _You can use free platforms such as Typeform to help you create surveys in minutes and send them to your audience to identify your ICP._
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/66e8a09b92a32dad74ad3bd6_64883dae92750615c6cb8134_typeform-example.png)
**Step 2. Conduct competitor research** to see what kind of features or services they offer that you don't. This competitive analysis will allow you to adapt and enhance your SaaS strategies to better meet the market demands.
Knowing which feature of your competitors attracts their users might help you develop your tool and make it more satisfying to use.
You can do this by outreaching your competitors’ users and chatting with them, reading reviews on competitors’ websites or platforms such as [G2](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.g2.com>), [Capterra](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.capterra.com>), [Trustpilot](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.trustpilot.com>), etc.
Knowing your target audience and their needs will give you the insight to refine and improve your product offering. 
From there, it'll be easier to create an effective strategy that will allow you to grow your business.
### 2. Analyze Your Current Position
Before creating a growth plan for your SaaS business,**you must look at where you are now.**
![determine-your-current-position](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/66e8a09b92a32dad74ad3bd9_64883dd3e4ef837251ab209b_determine-your-current-position.png)
**Analyzing your current position and performance** gives you a better understanding of the foundation that you have to build on.
**Step 1.** Start by looking at [the growth metrics](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.omnius.so/blog/saas-growth-metrics>) that define your success: 
  * Growth Rate, 
  * Monthly Recurring Revenue, 
  * Customer Lifetime Value, 
  * Churn Rate, 
  * and other key performance indicators (KPIs). 


How has each of these changed over time? 
If they've remained stagnant or declined, it may be time to reassess your strategies.
**Step 2.** Review the current state of your team and resources. 
Ask yourself these questions:
  * What strengths do you have in terms of personnel and budget? 
  * And where could you use additional support? 


**Identifying potential gaps will help you determine** **what areas of your business need more attention** to achieve growth.
Because if you start growing a business without first solving these parts will cause your business to collapse. 
**Step 3.** Finally, analyze how well your product resonates with customers. 
By following questions, you should ask yourself and find out: 
  * Are users satisfied with their experience? 
  * Do they find value in your product and its features? 


Assessing user feedback can help inform whether or not to change anything before investing further in growth plans.
### 3. Attract Qualified Leads with Product-Led Content
[**Product-led content**](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.omnius.so/blog/product-led-content>)is increasingly becoming an integral aspect of any successful SaaS growth strategy. By leveraging growth strategy software, you can ensure that your content resonates with your Ideal Customer Persona (ICP) and drives high-quality leads.
**Product-led** content helps you put your product into the narrative to solve your ICPs problem and natively present your product's features through the context.
It’s effective because it helps you drive organic traffic to your website, build trust with potential customers, and establish your brand’s authority in the marketplace. 
All this leads to more conversions and sales if done properly.
Here’s an example of product-led content.
Ahrefs, for example, uses this framework to educate its audience about SEO and shows the best practices by natively including its SEO tool within the content.
![ahrefs-keyword-research-example](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/66e8a09b92a32dad74ad3bf3_64883df96cfd3cc838a7c404_ahrefs-keyword-research-example.png)
By teaching their readers how to research and get tons of keyword opportunities in a minute, it subconsciously shows them it’s a great [SEO keyword research tool](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.omnius.so/blog/best-free-seo-keyword-research-tools>).
On the other hand, it automatically educates users on how to use the tool, so they don't need onboarding if they start using it.
Isn’t that great?
It’s proven that investing in content marketing [costs 62% less](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic>) than traditional marketing and generates 3x as many [leads for businesses](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.ai-bees.io/post/generate-more-sales-leads>).
Knowing this fact makes it a logical move for SaaS businesses to invest in.
On the other hand, by leveraging SEO, you can ensure that your content reaches the right audience –**those actively searching for solutions related to your offer.**
And that is our next SaaS growth strategy.
### 4. Leverage Your SEO Growth
Investing in SEO is essential for every SaaS company looking for growth and success. 
And combining it with product-led content makes it a powerful sales machine.
**SEO brings in organic visitors, while product-led content helps you convert those visitors into leads and paying customers.**
To improve SEO, you should **make your website SEO-friendly.**
In short, this strategyincludes the following:
  * ‍**Make your website SEO-friendly** - You can start this by solving the Technical SEO issues, ensuring your website is fast and mobile friendly, and optimizing your pages for the target keywords.**‍**
  * **Generate leads with content marketing** - Make sure to create helpful content such as case studies, eBooks, blog posts, infographics, and videos to engage your audience. **‍**
  * **Promote your content** - To get maximum mileage out of your content, you should utilize every channel you have, from social media to emails, for promoting it.**‍**
  * **Use the power of backlinks** - Making your website SEO-optimized will help you drive qualified traffic and save tons of $ you would spend on paid Ads, for example, **which is what makes SEO so powerful.**


![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/66e8a09a92a32dad74ad3bbe_64883e1ba218588cb659447f_seo-benefits.png)
### 5. Maximize User Engagement
Maximizing user engagement is a vital part of any successful SaaS business. 
**User engagement helps you increase customer loyalty, encourages customers to use the product more often, and can even lead to increased revenue.**
Here are several strategies that can help you maximize user engagement in 2024:
#### 1. Use the live chat
Using **data from customer surveys, live chat support tickets, and other sources** can help you understand your customers' needs better.
And [according to Hubspot](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/blog.hubspot.com/sales/live-chat-go-to-market-flaw?_ga=2.226623133.1017205035.1569314601-1888899486.1547522065>), customer satisfaction is at its highest level if you go with live chat.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/66e8a09a92a32dad74ad3bbb_64883e6539271ad8648fa08d_customer-satisfaction-ratings.png)
It allows you to create a **personalized user experience that involves understanding each user's needs** and tailoring the product or service accordingly. 
On the other hand, users love the one-on-one approach. 
That way, they feel more important to you, so why not do it for them?! 😊
#### 2. Use automated triggers
**Automated triggers are messages sent out at predetermined** times based on specific actions taken by users. 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/66e8a09a92a32dad74ad3bc1_64883e7ce5ee8770a893d665_tidio-chat.png)
For example, if a customer completes a purchase but has yet to use the product after two weeks, you can send them an automated email reminding them of its benefits.
By using automated triggers consistently throughout the year, you can ensure that your users remain engaged with your products or services.
#### 3. Leverage social media presence
**Leveraging social media platforms** as an additional way to engage with your customers can be valuable to connect with users on a deeper level.
Social media allows businesses to **create conversations with users and build relationships** through meaningful interactions. 
You should take advantage by engaging with existing customers and encouraging new ones on social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.
### 6. Utilize Email Marketing & Newsletter
Email marketing is an effective way to reach prospects and customers alike. 
According to SaleCycle, [50% of people](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.salecycle.com/blog/stats/18-essential-email-marketing-statistics/>) make at least one purchase per month from marketing emails.
By regularly sending emails to customers, you can keep them informed of new releases and provide helpful resources to help them use your software more effectively. 
Additionally, newsletters are a great way to build relationships with your audience by providing valuable information they can use in their business.
Investing in email marketing and newsletters allow you to increase customer engagement and loyalty, which is essential for any successful SaaS company.
You can use email to **promote your product, offer discounts and special deals** , and build customer relationships.
And to launch an effective email campaign, establishing an email list is the first step.
**But how can you attract potential subscribers to give you their**[**valid email addresses**](https://www.omnius.so/blog/<https:/www.usebouncer.com/how-to-verify-email-addresses/>)**?**
**Create ebooks, checklists** , or **other types of valuable resources** to attract subscribers and make them sign up.
Here’s how to do it with minimum effort:
**Step 1.** If you already have a blog with existing readers, **filter the best-performing blog posts on your website**.
See what your audience mostly loves to read about - what’s the topic about?
**Step 2.** Now **use a few of the best-performing blog posts on that topic** and **combine them into an eBook guide**. 
Add some well-researched and updated information about the topic, and a couple of actionable tips they can’t find at every corner, and you’re done.
It’s ready for distribution and growing your email list.
**Note:** _If you don’t have design experience, you can use one of Canva’s templates to create an eBook easily._
And how to get those first subscribers?
Well, simply distribute it everywhere where your audience is.
> **Pro tip:** If your audience is also on Product Hunt, and it probably is, you can distribute your eBook there to grab some attention and increase its visibility. Maybe even get a social proof such as “**Product of the day/week.** ”
![product-hunt-publish](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/66e8a09a92a32dad74ad3bc4_64883ea887a0ae9e520e3efd_product-hunt-publish.png)
‍
### 7. Streamline Your Pricing Model 
When scaling your business, streamlining your pricing model should be a top priority as part of your SaaS growth strategy.
**Your pricing model is the foundation of your revenue strategy** and can significantly impact your bottom line. 
It's essential to have a**well-established pricing structure that will meet your customers' needs** while maximizing revenue opportunities.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/66e8a09a92a32dad74ad3bc7_64883ecae545bb88ffab5c8b_software-pricing-model-process.png)
So how to find your perfect pricing model?
Well, nothing is great at first, but you can always test and work on improving it.
Here are 3 actionable tips to help you improve your pricing strategy immediately after reading this article:
**1. Create a subscription model** - Find an ideal subscription-based pricing model for your SaaS product to generate more income.
**2. Create different pricing levels** - Providing different pricing plans to your customers makes it more flexible to pick the most suitable one.
**3. Develop pricing for each customer** - Figure out the terms of pricing for each type of customer and how that could impact your business growth.
With the right approach, you'll be able to maximize revenue opportunities and remain competitive in an ever-changing market.
### 8. Keep Improving Performance
The SaaS industry is constantly changing, and staying up-to-date with new developments and innovations is crucial. 
![pdca-cycle-for-continuous-improvement-in-software-testing](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/646e102d45c5ccbcf27140b1/66e8a09a92a32dad74ad3bca_64883ee979e3a9444148ed04_pdca-cycle-for-continuous-improvement-in-software-testing.png)
Customers expect more value from SaaS solutions, so here are some additional tips to keep your product at the top of the game:
  * **Monitor industry trends** - track what's new and what currently works for other SaaS companies so you can test it out in your case.
  * **Experiment with new ideas** - be creative, and don't be afraid to try something new, maybe you will invent some trend that performs.
  * **Listen to your customer** - use customer feedback to improve the design and functionality of your SaaS product.

The old marketing addage, “It costs more to get a new customer than it is to retain one,” [has been proven](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/media.bain.com/Images/BB_Prescription_cutting_costs.pdf>) time and time again.
And for SaaS companies, this couldn’t be more true. According to the [RAIN Group](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/how-many-touches-does-it-take-to-make-a-sale>), it takes 8 marketing touches to get an initial meeting with a potential customer and who knows how many more meetings, demos, and sales pitches after that until they convert. All of those marketing campaigns and salesperson hours cost (a lot of) money.
Thankfully, the prevalence of subscription-based plans in the SaaS industry keeps customers chugging along, working in your platform, and covering your costs for software development. Assuming, of course, they don’t find a reason to leave.
But sometimes they do. In fact, KeyBanc Capital Markets’ [2022 Private SaaS Company Survey](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.key.com/content/dam/kco/documents/businesses___institutions/2022_kbcm_saas_survey_10-20-22_vF.pdf>) reported that most respondents indicated an average of roughly 10% of ARR that had been up for renewal but failed to realize.
So what leads a paying customer to defect—and more importantly, how do you prevent it? In this article, we’ll review the challenges of retaining customers, provide goal customer retention rates and metrics, and wrap up with ten of our favorite customer retention strategies to achieve predictable revenue growth over time.
## The challenges of SaaS customer retention
As explained above, while customer retention is vital to any business, it’s even more critical for SaaS companies. [Subscription-based business models](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.maxio.com/subscription-management>) require customers to remain continually subscribed to ensure profitability.
Unfortunately, there are various reasons an existing customer might opt for a new software solution and your key to combatting these challenges is to first know what you’re up against. Below are some of the common challenges associated with SaaS customer retention.
  * **Market competition:** With numerous SaaS companies offering similar services, customers have more options to choose from. SaaS companies must remain competitive to retain their customers.
  * **Low customer satisfaction rates:** Customer satisfaction is critical to retaining customers, as dissatisfied customers are significantly more likely to switch to a competitor.
  * **Non-competitive pricing:** SaaS companies must price their services competitively to retain customers. High prices may lead to [customer churn](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.maxio.com/saaspedia/what-is-churn>), while low prices may negatively impact the company’s profitability.
  * **Declining product/service quality:** SaaS companies must deliver high-quality products/services to retain customers. Poor-quality services will almost certainly lead to customer churn, negative reviews, and damage to the company’s reputation.
  * **Inefficient onboarding:** It’s crucial to ensure that the onboarding process is smooth and efficient to prevent customers from churning. Do not underestimate how quickly a customer will choose one service over another based on convenience.


There are more challenges for SaaS customer retention to be sure, but these are some of the biggest ones. However, by optimizing and keeping tabs on the customer experience, nearly all of these challenges can be mitigated.
## Metrics for measuring customer retention
So, how does one ‘keep tabs on the customer experience,’ you may wonder?
To effectively manage customer retention, your best bet is to measure and track the following [SaaS metrics](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.maxio.com/saas-metrics>) and KPIs over time. This data will help you identify areas of improvement and spot issues before they hurt total revenue. The most important and indicative metrics to watch include:
  * **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV)** measures the total revenue a customer is expected to generate over the entire period of time they use a company’s products/services. _CLV = Customer Value x Average Customer Lifespan_
  * **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** measures the total cost of acquiring a new customer. _CAC = Total Sales and Marketing Expenses ÷ Number of New Customers Acquired_
  * **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** measures customer satisfaction and loyalty by asking customers, on a scale of 1-10, how likely they are to recommend a company to others. Promoters respond highly with scores 9 or 10, passives respond with 7 or 8, and detractors respond with 6 or lower. _NPS = Percent of Promoters – Percent of Detractors_
  * **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** measures the predictable revenue you have coming in each month, and is found by multiplying the number of subscribers’ active accounts with the average revenue per user (ARPU). _MRR = Number of Active Accountsx ARPU Monthly Billing_
  * [**Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.maxio.com/blog/why-you-should-double-down-on-nrr-during-a-downturn>) measures the revenue retained from existing customers after accounting for churn, upgrades, and downgrades. _NRR = (MRR at the End of the Period – Expansion MRR Contraction MRR) ÷ MRR at the Beginning of the Period_
  * **Customer Churn** Rate measures the percentage of customers who cancel their subscription within a given period, including customers who have paused subscriptions._Customer Churn Rate = Number of Customers Churned within a Given Period ÷ Total Number of Customers within the Same Period_


We believe decisions should be made based on data, and the metrics here are highly recommended for inclusion in your monthly, quarterly, and annual reporting.

## 10 effective SaaS customer retention strategies
Based on what we’ve already covered, you can see how customer experience and product quality work hand in hand to keep customers engaged for longer periods of time—so now it’s time to dig into the details and review ten strategies focusing on customer retention.
### 1. Prioritize a smooth onboarding process
You know what’s bad for customer retention? Signing a contract, gearing up to implement a solution, and getting lost in the process. Or worse, getting left behind or forgotten about entirely.
While you should make it easy for customers to sign up, you can’t stop there. Pave the path for a smooth product experience by having an onboarding specialist help users set up their dashboard to best meet the required needs. Provide a self-guided knowledge base that users can learn from, with detailed instructions and tutorials. Or, consider having the customer support team host a monthly training webinar to walk through the most commonly asked questions—then use those recorded calls to build a library of videos for users to access later as needed.
Generally speaking, the best way to assess the strength of your onboarding is to put yourself in the customer’s shoes at every stage. A good place to start is to ask yourself, “What would I need if I were just signing up?”
### 2. Provide a superior customer experience
Providing an exceptional customer [experience](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.maxio.com/customer-experience>) is crucial for customer retention—and you can do this by making sure every aspect of your software and support process meets your customers’ expectations.
  * **Ensure software features are consistently functional.** You already know this is your number one priority—but scaling your development team to handle the project load takes careful planning. 
  * **Maintain transparency regarding updates.** Bugs will occur, but maintaining an update priority calendar and communicating with users will go a long way in building trust.
  * **Make the paperwork effortless.** From initial sign-up to monthly billing and annual customer renewals, automating your processes will help keep things moving. Recurring auto-billing and invoicing features help to reduce churn rates, keep your finances healthy, and keep you focused on providing high-quality products and services to your users.


Also, keep in mind: having a strong human touch in your company interactions with customers can go a _very_ long way. People won’t always remember what you said or what your product did, but they’ll _always_ remember how your company made them feel.
### 3. Continuously improve the product
Even if your SaaS technology is doing well right now, it’s not evergreen—no technology is. As tech abilities, market demand, and user interests constantly evolve, you need to stay ahead of the curve and constantly be willing to [make things better](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.insivia.com/saas-website-redesign/>).
For this reason, you should continuously seek out customer feedback and take a serious look at recurring themes as they come in. But more than that—you need to take action and improve your product to ensure it meets the needs and expectations of your customer base. Do this through regular updates and new feature releases that address growing trends in the industry.
### 4. Offer value-added services
Another strategy to increase customer retention is to offer an array of add-on services and features. These offers are supplemental to your core product.
For instance, you might choose to offer an extended and ultra-personalized onboarding or platform set-up service. You could provide consulting on an as-needed basis. Or, provide assistance in creating and reading analytics reports.
Separately, and if you don’t do so already, you might offer tiered access to certain platform features, or create an a-la-carte menu of features for users to select from.
These paid services and features are more than just an upsell or money grab—they help customers get the most out of your product, building a solution that’s truly tailored to their needs, and increasing their loyalty.
### 5. Implement a customer loyalty program
Plenty of companies use loyalty programs to entice current customers to maintain their subscriptions, and luckily, there are many ways to structure a customer loyalty program that helps retain your most valuable customers without eating into your profitability.
For example, you might offer customers quarterly perks—small surprises they earn just by keeping their engagement going. Offer up the chance to test or access new features early. Or, offer your most successful and loyal customers the chance to build brand awareness in a co-branded marketing campaign by promoting them as a customer success case study.
Another similar option is to create a referral program for your loyal customers to benefit from when referring friends and colleagues to your software. The reason: word-of-mouth advertising has dual benefits. The first is the zero-cost acquisition of new leads—and that’s a big win, surely. But the second lesser-spoken-of benefit is the positive reinforcement existing customers experience. Just like how repeating daily affirmations can increase a person’s self-esteem, continually speaking highly of your software can help mentally reinforce your users’ loyalty. A small referral credit toward a future invoice is surely worth it!
### 6. Provide excellent customer support
While this should go without saying, it’s worth mentioning out loud. SaaS companies absolutely need to provide fast and efficient customer support to retain their customers. In this age of instant gratification, your customers will expect fast responses to solve any problems they experience—and the higher your price point, the faster they’ll want that service.
And what if you can’t meet their customer support expectations? Well, they’ll quickly grow frustrated, lose confidence, and look for the ‘unsubscribe’ button.
The best way to do so is to hire a fully trained and easily accessible customer support team. Make sure support specialists are experts on your product, and able to answer questions without transferring users to another specialist. Provide multiple access points for customers to reach a support member, including phone, chat, and email. And when possible, try to personalize the experience. Have specialists review customers’ previous support requests to look for recurring issues and solve the source of the problem.
### 7. Engage with customers
If you think about it, customer engagement is a core element—dare we say, a requirement—of any SaaS product. You need to listen, understand, and serve your customers’ needs in order to fulfill them.
This level of ongoing engagement can be done at a high level through timed, automated email campaigns. Personalized message announcements and tagged email funnels based on users’ specific interests are perfect examples. Better yet, cultivate two-way conversations with your customers via social media. Post thought-provoking industry insights, ask for software requests, or share updates and behind-the-scenes looks at how your company functions. You might even host an ‘Ask Me Anything’ type forum event or webinar. Whatever your plan, be sure to open lines of communication and engage your community in conversation.
This sounds easy enough, but in reality, it can be a lot to offer this kind of personalized outreach. But the insights you’ll gain, the relationships you build, and the loyalty you’ll garner will be well worth the effort.
### 8. Take action on customer feedback
This brings us to our next strategy: Not simply collecting feedback, but taking action on it. However it’s gained, whether via user surveys, social sentiment data, customer support notes, or otherwise, this important information should never go to waste. Instead, store it in a centralized location and review it at regular intervals.
Acting on this feedback and taking real strides towards solving users’ pain points with your software and creating new tools to better serve them can help retain customers, attract new ones, and extend the customer lifecycle.
### 9. Monitor key metrics
[SaaS CFOs](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.maxio.com/blog/role-of-the-saas-cfo>) should regularly monitor key metrics, like those mentioned earlier, to identify areas of improvement and spot issues before they hurt total revenue. By monitoring user behavior and identifying trends, SaaS businesses can address retention issues proactively. For example, if overall product usage suddenly drops, you can be alerted and take action before customers churn.
If you truly want to understand your customer retention metrics and financial health, using a dedicated platform like [Maxio](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.maxio.com/>) is your best bet. Maxio offers several features to help SaaS companies better monetize their businesses, including built-in LTV, CAC, and ARR reporting, so you can identify your most profitable customers, find trends in their customer experience, and optimize their marketing and sales efforts to replicate this experience more frequently. Taking this kind of proactive approach and monitoring customer retention metrics will drive revenue growth and increase profitability.
### 10. Take the questions out of invoicing
When signing on with a SaaS platform, each customer will have different needs. Some will be able to handle your standard contract and payment terms, while others may need flexibility on contract terms, payment methods, or billing frequencies. Having the flexibility to meet those varying needs will go a long way in establishing the foundation for a long-term customer relationship.
You can take all the questions out of monthly billing by utilizing easy-to-understand itemized invoice templates that clearly state how the total amount due was determined. And for the utmost ease of [billing](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.maxio.com/subscription-billing>), invoicing, and payment collections, offer your customers a user-friendly self-service portal that they can manage on their own time, at their convenience.
## Make SaaS customer retention issues a thing of the past
Customer retention is a crucial aspect of any business, especially for SaaS companies. Retaining existing customers is far less expensive than acquiring new ones, and it leads to revenue growth, as loyal subscribers are more likely to purchase add-ons and refer others to the business. Being proactive in identifying and addressing any retention issues as they arise is the best way to maintain high customer retention rates.
Fortunately, software tools have made it easier than ever for SaaS companies to manage customer retention strategies effectively. For example, at Maxio, our [financial insights platform](https://www.maxio.com/blog/<https:/www.maxio.com/product/maxio-platform>) is designed specifically for SaaS businesses to uncover business insights—such as metrics that can measure customer churn—and scale their financial operations with flexibility and control.

When it comes to attracting new business, failing to plan is – as the saying goes – planning to fail.
**We’ve drawn up 7 customer acquisition strategies that will help you to achieve your business growth goals and ensure the longevity of your enterprise.** To ensure you’re able to make the most of these techniques, we’ll give you a crash course in exactly what customer acquisition is, why it’s important, and the challenges that you may face when trying to attract new clients.

## What Is a Customer Acquisition Strategy?
As the name suggests, a customer acquisition strategy is **the blueprint a business uses to attract new customers**. Your business’s customer acquisition strategy is a roadmap that helps you to take individuals from your target audience and lead them to becoming actual paying customers.
**Creating a strong customer acquisition strategy will help to ensure that you have a continual flow of new customers so that you can grow your business and profits.**
Every worthwhile customer acquisition strategy has three main pillars around which the overall strategy is built: 
  * **Attracting:** Sparking the interest of your [target audience](https://pay.com/blog/</blog/how-to-identify-your-target-market>) to turn individuals in that group into leads.
  * **Nurturing:** Communicating with leads to develop and maintain a relationship with them to drive sales readiness.
  * **Converting:** Driving the customer to purchase your goods or services once they’ve been primed during the nurturing stage.


For SaaS businesses, which generally operate using a [subscription model](https://pay.com/blog/</blog/subscription-business-model>), it’s also important to nurture relationships with existing customers to ensure that they continue to use your product.
## What Are the Challenges of Customer Acquisition in SaaS?
The nature of the SaaS industry and products means that encouraging new buyers to come on board can be a challenge. Let’s explore some of the main challenges of customer acquisition for SaaS businesses.
### Competition
Recent research shows that there are more than 30,000 SaaS companies worldwide. Of that number, one company accounts for 10% of the total market share. This **distribution of customers as well as the similarity between products and services provided by SaaS businesses make for an extremely competitive market.**
With thousands of companies vying for the attention of potential customers – and new competitors entering the market all the time – it can be challenging for SaaS entities to differentiate themselves. **To maintain a competitive edge, companies must continually innovate to stay relevant and set themselves apart from the rest of the market.**
### High Costs
Attracting and retaining customers for your SaaS business can be expensive.**The competition within the market means that paid advertising expenses are generally quite high.** Plus, the number of alternate solutions available to your target audience tends to drive [churn](https://pay.com/blog/</blog/how-to-do-churn-analysis>) and reduce customers’ overall lifetime value (LTV).
With an increased customer acquisition cost (CAC) and a reduction in the expected LTV, the ratio between these two values is likely to be skewed. This is a sign that your business is not earning a satisfactory [return on investment (ROI)](https://pay.com/blog/</blog/how-to-calculate-roi>) and may run into issues with profitability further down the line.
### Differentiation
There are loads of software solutions on the market all seemingly solving the same user problems. This can make it incredibly challenging to stand out from the crowd in the SaaS market and encourage customers to pick your product over a competitor’s.
The key here is to focus on that final ‘S’ in the SaaS acronym.**Offering your customers exceptional service over and above the actual programs you provide – and clearly demonstrating those services on your website – will help you to set your business apart from other SaaS entities.**
### Knowledge Gaps
Many customers look for SaaS tools that solve a specific problem. On the flip side of the coin, most SaaS products have a plethora of features and use cases. **This mismatch between customers’ perceived needs and the complexity of programs can make it difficult for you to convince buyers that your solution is right for them.**
Privacy is another area where a shortfall in customer’s knowledge can affect their uptake of a particular product. As SaaS solutions are generally cloud-based, some customers may be hesitant to sign up and allow an unfamiliar program to process their information on external servers.
## How to Develop a Customer Acquisition Strategy for SaaS
As we mentioned earlier, your customer acquisition strategy should be built around attracting, nurturing, and converting leads. Let’s take a closer look at each of these steps.
### Attracting Leads
**The first stage of your customer acquisition strategy revolves around building awareness.** If your target audience isn’t aware that your business exists or what SaaS tools you provide, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to sell anything to them.
Potential customers will probably start their search by trying to better understand the problem that they’re trying to solve. To start, they’re likely using a search engine to do some research. **You can use**[**marketing strategies**](https://pay.com/blog/</blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategies>)**to build awareness and trust in your brand by establishing your authority in your niche.**
Knowledge-sharing is important here. Creating SEO blog posts that answer user questions and contributing to other relevant articles will help to boost your online presence. [Endorsements from satisfied customers](https://pay.com/blog/</blog/how-to-get-your-customers-to-write-reviews>) and paid promotions will also help to position you as the go-to provider in your space.
### Nurturing Leads
Now that you have your prospects’ attention, you’ll need to get them to interact with your business. This is by far the most lengthy – and important – part of your customer acquisition strategy.
**Engaging with your audience will solidify your relationship with them and help to encourage them to choose your product over competitors'.** The only way to engage, though, is by having your customers’ contact information on hand. For SaaS businesses, the best ways to do this are by collecting email addresses through:
  * Promoting newsletter signups
  * Offering gated content and resources
  * Adding calls-to-action to key pages of your website


**When audience members opt in to receiving communications from your business, it’s a great sign that they’re interested in the products you offer and want to learn more.** At this stage, it’s time to move them towards exploring more about your offering.
Targeted email campaigns are an invaluable tool for encouraging exploration. Segmenting subscribers, sending them case studies, communicating product features, and highlighting other selling points will help customers to better understand how your tool can help them solve their problem.
**Once you’ve piqued their interest, it’s time to get your leads to explore your products.** How you do this will vary depending on your business model, but the most common approaches are by offering a free trial or a freemium version of your software.
### Converting (and Retaining) Leads
Finally, it’s time to seal the deal. **Targeted messaging and calls-to-action are useful tools to encourage your lead to take the final step and convert.**
Sending emails to free-trial users reminding them that their trial period is about to expire and providing them with a sign-up link is one option. Adding a call-to-action to the dashboard of freemium software and showing features only available on paid versions is another tactic. A good old-fashioned sales pitch from someone on your team can help, too. 
However, the work doesn’t end when you have your new client on board. **The nature of SaaS businesses means that retaining customers is just as important as converting leads for sustained growth.**
An effective [customer retention strategy](https://pay.com/blog/</blog/how-to-increase-customer-retention>) is one of the best ways to get more value out of your clients. Maintaining the relationship you’ve built as you attracted and nurtured leads starts with providing an **effective welcome email and onboarding resources** that will help customers to make the most of your product. 
**You’ll also want to ensure that your infrastructure – like your**[**online payments**](https://pay.com/blog/</online-payments>)**system – provides a seamless, secure experience.**[**Pay.com**](https://pay.com/blog/</>)’s full-service payment infrastructure allows you to accept a variety of [payment methods](https://pay.com/blog/</payment-methods>) and reduces friction during the checkout process. 
Our developer-friendly API means that you can create a [custom checkout page](https://pay.com/blog/</features/checkout>) tailored to your business’s unique needs. What’s more, our best-in-class security features (like [3D Secure 2.0](https://pay.com/blog/</features/3d-secure-2-0>)) ensure that your enterprise is protected from fraudulent transactions.
**From there on, it’s a matter of pursuing regular interactions with your users.** Sharing updates about your company and products, providing early or free access to new features, and asking for feedback about your tools and service are all great ways to keep users engaged.
## 7 Customer Acquisition Strategies for SaaS Companies
We’ve identified 7 customer acquisition strategies that SaaS companies can use to bring in new clients. Many of these methods can be used in conjunction with one another to maximize their efficacy. 
### 1. Search Engine Optimization
Search engine optimization (or SEO) is one of the most powerful tools in your customer acquisition toolbox. **Ensuring that your content is optimized for search engines will help to ensure that it ranks on results pages.** This will ultimately drive more organic traffic to your website.
Here are three areas where your can implement SEO:
  * **Keywords: Find relevant keywords using tools like Answer The Public or Ahrefs and incorporate these into your page and blog post titles.**
  * **Links: Build a network of internal links to help guide users and search engines around your website’s content.**
  * **Images: Optimize your images to load quickly and add alt text to improve the user experience on your pages.**


There are plenty more ways that you can improve your SEO, but these are a great place to start.
### 2. Content Marketing
Content is king when it comes to building your brand’s authority with your target audience. **Creating relevant, educational blog posts, videos, news articles, and other pieces of content can help you to be recognized as an expert in your field.**
The easiest way to take advantage of content marketing is to set up a blog. This platform will allow you to explore a range of topics that your intended customers care about. You can share a variety of types of content (think videos, how-tos, or FAQs) to show your knowledge while also taking advantage of SEO.
**Start by identifying three core pillars that you want to build content around and get creating from there.** This will ensure that you can build an internal linking strategy within your content. Plus, it can prevent you from spending time producing irrelevant material.
### 3. Social Media Marketing
**A tried and true method for acquiring customers is to meet your potential clients where they are. In the digital age, that place is social media.**
To increase your chances of success with [social media marketing](https://pay.com/blog/</blog/how-to-market-your-small-business-on-social-media>), you’ll want to ensure that you have a good idea of who your target audience is, which social networks they use, and the types of content they prefer (e.g. video, images, or short-form copy).
**Strike a balance between organic posts and paid content.** Although organic posts might not garner the most attention, potential customers are unlikely to trust a brand that has loads of paid promotions but whose profile is empty.
### 4. Word-of-Mouth Marketing
Customers who are referred to a business by someone in their network are four times more likely to buy that business’s product. Plus, 93% of customers online read reviews and 79% put as much importance on these reviews as referrals.
All of that to say: **Word-of-mouth marketing is a fantastic way to generate highly qualified leads.**
Taking satisfied customers and turning them into promoters will bring big rewards. **A simple way to do this to ask your customers to share their experience with your brand.** However, you’ll want to ensure that this process is as easy as possible for those customers so that you don’t negatively affect your good impression.
### 5. Email Marketing
As we’ve already mentioned, email is an extremely useful customer acquisition strategy. Despite the fact that many experts believed that social media would eradicate email, it remains one of the most effective marketing tools overall and boasts a whopping 4,200% ROI.
**Sending regular emails, performing A/B tests, and monitoring readers’ interactions with your content will help you to identify what works and what doesn’t.**
Understanding which emails your readers are opening and where they’re clicking is useful for retargeting emails to help you better serve your subscriber base. Plus, segmenting your audience will reduce the chances that readers receive irrelevant emails and unsubscribe.
### 6. Gated Content
Generating gated – or, more aptly, lead-gen – content is another important customer acquisition strategy. **Here, you’ll offer users access to resources like ebooks, templates, guides, and white papers in exchange for their personal information (e.g. names and email addresses).**
This type of content will help you to identify more qualified leads. As the information you’re providing is highly valuable and requires more resources to create, more interested users are generally willing to supply their details. 
Another benefit is the fact that **this content can be used to enhance other customer acquisition strategies.** For example, you can create a search engine optimized landing page, promote it via social media, or create an email campaign around it.
### 7. Product Pricing
**In a highly competitive market like the SaaS arena, your**[**product pricing strategy**](https://pay.com/blog/</blog/product-pricing-strategies>)**can make all the difference in customer acquisition.** This is especially true if you offer particularly good prices or your model is unique among your competitors.
Naturally, offering something for nothing is bound to attract a lot of interest. Free trials and tools might not make you any money immediately, but they do open the door for later purchases and upselling. What’s more, customers who have the opportunity to try before they buy are more receptive to subsequent marketing strategies.
**In addition to free trials and freemium pricing, you could provide discounted pricing or promotional pricing** (think buy one, get one free or ‘25% off if you purchase a full year upfront’, respectively).

  2. Closely monitor your SaaS product usage

A robust customer success program involves [comprehensive onboarding](https://blog.powr.io/<https:/meetgeek.ai/blog/client-onboarding>), regular check-ins, training resources, and dedicated customer success managers.

By monitoring usage data and maintaining regular contact with customers, you can proactively identify any issues or opportunities for additional training. 
Helping customers realize their goals with your product will keep them onboard and turn them into advocates for your brand.
### Ways to Execute a Customer Success Program
#### **1. Provide Continuous Education:**
  * **Webinars and Tutorials:** Offering regular webinars, tutorials, and other educational content ensures customers fully understand your product. It helps maximize their usage and the value they derive, which, in turn, increases the likelihood of them recommending it to others.
  * **Knowledge Base & Guides:** Maintain an updated resource center with step-by-step guides and FAQs to help customers solve common issues independently.


#### **2. Deliver Top-Notch Customer Support:**
  * **Fast Response Times:** Quick and efficient customer support can turn satisfied customers into loyal advocates.
  * **Proactive Approach:** Regularly checking in on customers, addressing concerns before they escalate, and offering solutions ahead of time can significantly improve their experience.

  * **Track and Reward:** Use a simple system to track referrals and ensure customers receive their rewards promptly. This will motivate customers to spread the word about your SaaS.


### 2. Closely monitor your SaaS product usage 
It’s tough to spot customers who are nearing churn. NPS surveys can help identify detractors or a likely churn, but you've lost a precious customer by the time you have those insights.
In [SaaS churn management](https://blog.powr.io/<https:/churn360.com/guide/proven-strategies-to-reduce-customer-churn>), monitoring how your existing customers are using the product closely is critical. Are they facing any hurdles? Do they have any specific requirements? 
If your users are not using the platform to the optimum level or failing to contact customer support when they have an issue, there is a possibility of churn. 
Keep track of usage patterns, specifically by analyzing customer behavior towards your product and regularly monitoring any decrease in usage.
### How to Implement Usage Monitoring
#### **1. Implement Product Analytics:**
Product analytics provide valuable insights into how customers interact with your product.
By tracking which features are used most frequently, session durations, and common pain points, you can identify opportunities for product improvements and targeted customer outreach. 
Businesses can further enhance their product development by exploring solutions from [Syndicode](https://blog.powr.io/<https:/syndicode.com/services/saas-development/>), a specialized SaaS development company.
This data-driven approach helps you understand customer behavior and adapt your product to meet their evolving needs.
#### **2. Track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
Identify and monitor [KPIs that align with customer success](https://blog.powr.io/<https:/www.plecto.com/blog/customer-service/15-customer-service-kpis-you-need-be-tracking/>), such as active users, feature adoption, session frequency, and churn rate. 
Regular tracking of these KPIs allows you to quickly spot any deviations in user behavior that could signal emerging issues or potential churn risks. 
By keeping an eye on these metrics, you can proactively make adjustments to improve customer satisfaction.
#### **3. User Journey Mapping:**
Create user journey maps to visualize how customers navigate your product. This process highlights critical touchpoints and areas where customers encounter friction or drop off.
Understanding the user journey enables you to address bottlenecks and improve the overall experience.
#### **4. Set Up Automated Alerts:**
Automated alerts can notify you of significant changes in a customer's usage patterns, such as a sudden drop in logins or decreased interaction with essential features.
These alerts allow you to intervene early and re-engage customers before they decide to leave, reducing churn and enhancing customer retention.
### 3. Build a product community 
Lastly, help your [SaaS product](https://blog.powr.io/<https:/spdload.com/blog/what-is-saas-product/>) break free from silos wherein if a single customer encounters an issue, others are prepared to guide them. 
Similarly, if one customer discovers a more efficient way to incorporate your product or service, others can benefit from this valuable insight.

[Source](https://blog.powr.io/<https:/blog.payproglobal.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brand-community.png?width=730&name=brand-community.png>)
Although you may have to build a platform and act as an intermediary for gathering and sharing information, this all contributes to building a product community. 
Users can access and contribute by establishing a community encompassing knowledge bases, forums, and tutorials. It creates a mutually beneficial relationship where the community can enhance your brand's reputation.
  * #### Quick tips to start building a SaaS product community

The platform should be easy to use and accessible to your target audience.
**Share exclusive content:** Offering exclusive content or early access to new features can incentivize users to join and stay engaged in the community.
