## Introduction
Implementing and developing a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) product can seem daunting to beginners. But like any creative invention, the unique features of a product can be broken down into digestible parts. Therefore, this article aims to introduce what SaaS is, its distinct features, and the key agreements SaaS Companies must adopt in any given situation.
SaaS contracts, as you will learn in this article, are comprised of several components that are essential to protecting intellectual property in online marketplaces.
But before we dive into these terms, we need to take a quick look at what SaaS entails.
## What is SaaS?
SaaS stands for ‘Software as a Service’. Unlike any other licensing arrangement, SaaS typically adopts the following distinct features:
  1. The software is centrally hosted
  2. It typically has a subscription model
  3. No exchange of digital product
  4. No installation of software


In summary, the SaaS contract structure focuses on authorizing the use of the digital product in a central location rather than providing licensing rights to install the software.
SaaS contracts therefore, include service agreements (between the SaaS company and product users), company-level agreements, agreements with third parties, and public-facing agreements.
## The Contract between the SaaS Company and the Product User: Key Legal Considerations
A SaaS contract typically contains (without limitation to) the following terms:
  * Service Level Agreement: this outlines in a specific manner the service that the SaaS company agrees to offer, including uptime guarantees, support response times, and other performance metrics.
  * Scope of License: this spells out the scope of rights and limits the users receive throughout the contract term.
  * Subscription Terms: this outlines the duration of the subscription (including start and end dates), payment and renewal terms.
  * Data Privacy and Protection: this provides for customers data would be handled, data processing and data protection measures, and compliance with various data protection laws.
  * Limitation of Liability: this term includes the scope of liability of the SaaS company, often with a contractual damage cap.
  * Other typical terms include: access rights and users, indemnification, governing laws and jurisdiction, assignment, force majeure, warranties, confidentiality, termination, and amendment provisions.


## Other types of Agreements SaaS Companies need
Apart from the agreements SaaS companies develop with product users, there are other agreements required at various levels of engagements.
_Let’s take a brisk look below!_
  1. **Company-level agreements** : these are agreements between a SaaS company and its founders and/or employees. They are necessary operational documents that must be put in place at the start of any venture. They include:


  * Founder/shareholders Agreements
  * Non-compete agreements
  * Strict Confidentiality/Non-disclosure agreements
  * Intellectual Property transfer/assignment agreements
  * Employment agreements


2. **Third-Party agreements** : These are legal contracts between two major parties, where a third party is involved in some capacity. For example, in a SaaS arrangement, the SaaS Company and the customer are the major contracting parties, and any third-party provider or subcontractor used by the SaaS Company to deliver the service would be considered third parties to the agreement.
Third-Party agreements include:
  * Contractor agreements
  * Affiliate or partner agreements
  * Advisor agreements


3. **Public-facing agreements** : these are legal agreements intended to be made public. They include (but are not limited to):
  * Privacy policies
  * Security Policies
  * Trademark Policies
  * Disclosures


## Conclusion
In conclusion, the combination of these agreements protects a SaaS company’s Intellectual property, helps maximize the economic value of its products, and protects the SaaS company from legal liabilities arising from interactions with multiple parties in the chain.
Furthermore, as with all digital service offerings, it is imperative for SaaS companies to take responsibility for processing data in a manner that complies with global data privacy laws and principles. This will build mutual trust and bring enormous economic value to SaaS companies.

For software-as-a-service (SaaS) startups, navigating regulatory compliance takes a lot of work. Rules vary among countries and states. They also change, so current strategies might only work for a few years.
However, compliance is non-negotiable because violations lead to severe consequences. These range from harsh penalties and fines to irreparable damage to brand reputation.
This article discusses these top challenges and how an expert [SaaS marketing agency](https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/regulatory-compliance-saas-startups/<https:/www.digitalauthority.me/industries/saas-marketing-agency/>) helps you address each:
  * Data privacy and security.
  * Tax requirements.
  * Advertising and marketing regulations.


Read below for examples and tips to steer your business clear of non-compliance pitfalls.

## **1. Data Privacy and Security**
![website security_Developing network security system. Internet data security concept. Businessman using laptop.](https://www.digitalauthority.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shutterstock_1937344510-1.jpg)
As a cloud-based platform, SaaS is popular for its convenience, flexibility, and scalability. Consider a writing assistant tool. A blogger uses the basic plan to brainstorm ideas and edit content. 
As the blogger transitions to becoming an agency, they upgrade the services. For example, they choose a plan that adds more “seats” or builds a team. They maximize more professional features, such as keyword research or site audit. 
Unfortunately, the cloud-based business model and its benefits also make SaaS prone to data privacy and security challenges. These include the following:
  * Cloud misconfigurations that make the ecosystem or platform vulnerable to security risks.
  * Complicated access management (e.g., users create multiple accounts for every team member).
  * Big data storage, which makes SaaS appealing to cybercriminals wanting to steal information for financial gain.
  * Data theft and leaks, whether deliberate or accidental. 
  * Third-party access, which happens when SaaS startups work with other vendors for their operations (e.g., a hacker infiltrates a server containing your data).
  * Conflict between operational and informational technology systems (legacy versus automation).


All of these situations lead to non-compliance with some of the strictest safeguards in the world. One of these is Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Violating this law means paying a hefty fine of €20 million or up to 4% of your total global turnover of the previous year, whichever is higher. 
To grasp the severity of the penalty, [Meta had to pay €1.2 billion](https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/regulatory-compliance-saas-startups/<https:/www.bbc.com/news/technology-65669839>) for mishandling information transmitted between European countries and the United States.
In America, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives users the right to know how a business collects and uses their information. It also provides them the power to delete personal information.Non-compliance imposes a penalty of $2,500 per non-intentional violation and $7,500 for a deliberate act. Although the fee seems small, it can also compound. Imagine how much you will pay for a class-action lawsuit because you failed to mention certain privacy information during signup.
SaaS startups and marketers must work together to [prioritize data privacy and security](https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/regulatory-compliance-saas-startups/<https:/www.digitalauthority.me/resources/ensure-safety-with-custom-software-development/>) with these strategies: 
  * Consider applying a zero-trust policy, which requires strict identity verification for every user and device trying to access resources.
  * Implement access controls, such as multi-factor authentication and role-based access.
  * Enable transport and data encryption. 
  * Conduct regular security audits and risk assessments to find vulnerabilities.
  * Create and test incident response plans for potential data breaches.
  * Vet partners and institute data-sharing contracts. 
  * Provide data privacy and security training to employees.
  * Establish data retention policies and procedures.
  * Stay current on changing privacy regulations and adjust practices as appropriate.
  * Appoint a legal compliance officer, preferably a SaaS lawyer.


Data is more than a business asset. It is the foundation of trust and loyalty to customers. It exemplifies the values that matter the most to you. Protect it at all costs.
## **2. Tax Requirements**
![billing_Woman renter holding paper bills using calculator for business financial accounting calculate money bank loan rent payments manage expenses finances taxes doing paperwork concept, close up view](https://www.digitalauthority.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/shutterstock_1523326748-1.jpg)
[Many factors kill SaaS startups](https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/regulatory-compliance-saas-startups/<https:/www.digitalauthority.me/resources/saas-marketing-challenges/>), including poor tax compliance and how states (and countries) define the business model. 
For example, in America, seven states tax a SaaS business if it requires customers to download the software. They see the company as offering a product. Meanwhile, 24 states consider such a model as providing services. 
Tax laws themselves are also complicated. Connecticut charges a sales-wide tax rate of 6.35% on digital products. However, SaaS B2B transactions are subject to only 1% (certain conditions apply).
Many SaaS businesses are global and should also follow international tax requirements. The UK, for instance, levies businesses for selling cloud software subscriptions to its residents. 
Canada, on the other hand, charges a tax rate based on the customer’s location. It imposes a 5% goods and services tax if the customers are from British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba, among others. Ontario collects 13% as harmonized sales tax.
As if these confusing rules are not enough, you must also manage a growing list of taxes and their requirements. These include income and payroll taxes besides value-added tax. 
How do you handle tax obligations without overburdening your team with more administrative tasks and customers with higher costs?
A SaaS marketing agency helps establish clear guidelines on addressing taxation in campaigns. These include the following:
  * Ensure that marketing copy reflects transparent tax obligations. For example, the prices should mention whether they include or exclude tax and which specific taxes apply.
  * Display tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive pricing prominently and consistently across channels. 
  * Notify customers before any tax rate changes and explain its impact on pricing. 
  * Call out unique tax rules or exemptions for the product or service. 
  * Provide an accessible frequently asked questions (FAQs) section on taxes. 
  * Train creative teams on proper display and communication of taxes in materials they produce to adhere to regulations.


The agency also collaborates with sales and compliance teams to execute these strategies:
  * Build tax considerations into business processes early. The billing system, for example, integrates the tax rate when generating invoices.
  * Invest in robust billing and payment systems that support tax calculations. Find a system that integrates geolocation to determine appropriate rates.
  * Create a tax calendar to track critical filing and payment deadlines. 
  * Schedule regular reviews as laws change, especially before entering new markets.
  * Maintain detailed transaction records for easy auditing and verification. 
  * Seek advanced tax rulings to clarify uncertainties in new jurisdictions.
  * Automate tax document collection from customers to avoid errors. 
  * Conduct cross-border tax planning when expanding overseas. 


## **3. Advertising and Marketing Regulations**
![HIPAA compliance_Clerk reads documents about HIPAA Compliance.](https://www.digitalauthority.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shutterstock_1766979872-1.jpg)
Besides data privacy and security, advertising and marketing non-compliance is a pressing problem for businesses. In particular, they are prone to misleading advertising and committing intellectual property (IP) violations. 
The European Union, for instance, [slapped Google with an antitrust case](https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/regulatory-compliance-saas-startups/<https:/ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3207>) for distorting competition in advertising technology. Specifically, it accuses the tech giant of manipulating the system to favor its own ad tech, creating an unfair advantage. 
The violation is sometimes less obvious, though. Consider healthcare SaaS.
Because it handles personal health information (PHI), it must follow the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) rules. One of these is signing a business associate agreement (BAA), a legally binding contract between:
  * A HIPAA-covered entity such as a business or healthcare provider.
  * A business associate, an entity that handles PHI.


The problem is many online platforms are not HIPAA-compliant. Facebook, for example, will not enter into any BAA. This means the following campaigns violate the act: 
  * The business creates a Facebook ad campaign targeting specific doctor offices in Arizona.
  * The platform runs Facebook ads with before-and-after photos of one of its users who lost weight on a diet program. 
  * An automated campaign serves a Facebook ad to a user for a smoking cessation program immediately after they search for lung cancer treatments online. 
  * The platform retargets former app users with a Facebook ad saying, “We've missed you! Log back into our platform and catch up on managing your diabetes.”


SaaS startups might also be accused of IP violations. It can be as simple as one product or business model sharing similar features with a more established brand. It also happens because of licensing issues, especially when integrating third-party application programming interfaces (APIs) and libraries. 
In the generative AI era, IP problems often stem from the data the language models use to “learn” and improve their processes. These are often published online materials, some of which are proprietary. Getty versus Stable Diffusion is a perfect example of this situation. 
A capable SaaS marketing agency protects a startup from committing these mistakes using these tactics:
  * Review all marketing materials and campaigns at every development stage. For example, does it follow the CAN-SPAM Act? Does it adhere to the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act? Are the [digital marketing strategies HIPAA-compliant](https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/regulatory-compliance-saas-startups/<https:/www.digitalauthority.me/resources/hipaa-compliant-digital-marketing/>)?
  * Advise them on proper opt-in processes and disclaimer and disclosure language for emails, content offers, and other communications. 
  * Guarantee transparency in affiliate marketing programs and proper disclosure of paid influencer posts.
  * Vet lead generation tactics and platforms to avoid privacy violations or deceptive practices.
  * Establish processes to document customer consent across channels.
  * Consult on managing bidirectional data flows with customer relationship management (CRM) platforms to avoid prohibited uses of collected data.
  * Provide training on marketing compliance issues to startup staff involved with advertising.
  * Stay current on evolving marketing regulations and advise on necessary campaign adjustments.
  * Set up mechanisms to track compliance metrics.


## **Summing Up**
The growing popularity of SaaS opens bigger doors for innovation but also brings new regulatory challenges. 
Complying with regulations protects your vision and elevates your brand as trustworthy, credible, and safe. It also reduces unnecessary costs that come with security breaches, fines, and other penalties. Most of all, it avoids giving an unfair advantage to competitors that cut corners.

# Moving to a SaaS Business Model? 5 Legal Issues to Consider

When a software vendor makes the business decision to migrate from an on-premise software license model to a cloud-based software as a service arrangement (SaaS), there are several important legal issues to consider, including how changes to the business model will impact the vendor’s agreement with its customers. Let’s first review the basic differences between on-premise software and SaaS.
## On-premise vs. SaaS
Under an on-premise model, the vendor grants a copyright license to its customers that allows them to download, install, and use the vendor’s software on the customer’s computers. In exchange for this license grant, the customer pays a license fee to the vendor. Under a SaaS model, the vendor’s software is hosted in the cloud and customers access it remotely: the customer does not download, copy, or install it. As a result, a SaaS arrangement does not require a copyright license, because the customer never gets a copy of the vendor’s software. Instead, the SaaS vendor grants permission to access the software remotely, simply called an “access right.”
In addition, a SaaS arrangement differs from a traditional on-premise one in the following ways:
  * SaaS is akin to a time-limited, rental, or subscription arrangement, whereas on-premise often involves a perpetual right to use the software. 
  * SaaS enables vendors to easily update, upgrade, perform bug fixes and maintain their software without involving the customer. 
  * SaaS eliminates time-consuming and costly on-site installation at the customer location, which was often required for an on-premise arrangement, saving both parties time and money. 
  * In a SaaS model, the software is stored and maintained remotely, so the customer no longer needs servers and IT personnel to manage the on-premise software, reducing customer costs. 
  * In a SaaS model, the customer’s data may be processed, transferred, and stored in the cloud and responsibilities for ensuring the security of such data are often negotiated between the vendor and customer. In the on-premise model, aspects concerning the security of the customer’s data are usually the customer’s responsibility. 


## 5 legal issues to consider when migrating to a SaaS model 
Given the fundamental differences between the on-premise and SaaS models, vendors migrating to a SaaS business model should not use their legacy software license agreement, as it is no longer appropriate. Instead, vendors should employ a SaaS subscription agreement, which, among other things, addresses the following considerations: 
### 1. Access rights
Under a SaaS subscription agreement, the software vendor grants its customer a right to access the remotely hosted software. In exchange for this access right, the customer pays a subscription service fee. For example, Netflix employs a SaaS business model that provides on-demand movies via their remotely hosted software to which customers gain access in exchange for paying the subscription service fee.
> Under a SaaS model, the vendor’s software is hosted in the cloud and customers access it remotely: the customer does not download, copy, or install it.
### 2. Authorized users 
The individuals who may lawfully access the remotely hosted software are the customer’s “authorized users.” Their access and usage are subject to the terms of the SaaS subscription agreement. Accordingly, authorized users should be clearly defined in the agreement, and they may include the customer’s employees, affiliated companies, and designated subcontractors. Typically, the vendor will require the customer to assume responsibility for ensuring that all authorized users abide by the terms of the SaaS subscription agreement. 
### 3. Hosting provider implications 
Unless vendors have their own servers to host their software, they will need to contract with a hosting provider – such as Amazon Web Services or Akamai – to host their software before they may offer a SaaS option to customers. The terms of the hosting provider agreement will likely inform how certain provisions in the vendor’s SaaS subscription agreement are presented to the vendor’s customers. For example, the geographical location of the hosting provider’s servers will likely dictate which data privacy laws apply to data being processed, transferred, or stored when customers access the SaaS. Such data-related laws and regulations vary greatly around the globe. Some impose strict requirements and liabilities, so software vendors should consider this aspect when selecting a hosting provider.
> The geographical location of the hosting provider’s servers will likely dictate which data privacy laws apply to data being processed, transferred, or stored when customers access the SaaS.
The hosting provider’s agreement may also set out access-related parameters. For example, hosting providers generally do not guarantee 24/7 availability, and many observe preplanned technical maintenance periods when their servers – and anything hosted on them – will be inaccessible to the vendor and the vendor’s customers. Therefore, software vendors should ensure that the availability metrics they provide to customers in their SaaS-related service level agreements (or SLAs) synchronize with those the hosting provider offers. 
### 4**.** Vendor recourse 
Under an on-premise software arrangement, the customer has a copy of the vendor’s software, so vendors cannot easily stop the customer from continuing to use it if the customer breaches the agreement. However, if a SaaS customer breaches the agreement terms, a vendor may easily suspend their remote access until the customer is back in compliance. This leverage, and the conditions under which the vendor may impose it, should be stated in the SaaS subscription agreement. In addition, as in all commercial agreements, the vendor’s SaaS agreement should include legal recourse and remedies in the event the customer breaches. 
### 5**.** Data-related issues 
Issues relating to data ownership, data related liabilities, and privacy and security should be addressed in the SaaS agreement, because customer data is often transferred, processed, or stored in the cloud when the customer accesses the software. In addition, the SaaS agreement should address each party’s respective responsibilities and liabilities if a data breach occurs, noting that certain data-related laws and regulations may automatically govern certain aspects of a data breach. 
Finally, it is important to note that, just like most other commercial agreements, a SaaS subscription agreement should include standard commercial terms such as: 
  * Intellectual property ownership concerning the SaaS, brands, logos and data; 
  * Warranties and representations;
  * Indemnification and limitations of liability;
  * Confidentiality;
  * Payment and renewal terms; and
  * Dispute resolution.


## From the customer’s perspective 
Vendors may wish to consider a few key issues from the customer’s point of view, so they may create an established approach for responding to and addressing customer requests relating to the SaaS arrangement. These issues include:
  * **Data security** — Do the vendor’s technical safeguards align with the customer’s data security requirements? 
  * **Performance metrics** — Does the SaaS agreement’s SLA include uptime and performance metrics with respective remedies if such commitments are not met in a timely manner? 
  * **Termination rights** — Under what circumstances may the customer terminate the agreement, particularly if the proposed term of the SaaS arrangement is three years or longer? 
  * **Contract renewal** — Does the SaaS agreement auto-renew? If so, how much flexibility will the customer have at the time of renewal?
  * **Fee caps** — Are the vendor’s fee increases capped?
  * **Compliance guarantee** — Does the vendor agree to comply with applicable laws, as those may evolve during the term of the SaaS agreement?


Along the same lines, the SaaS vendor’s counsel may want to consider working together with their internal business partners to create a playbook on how to address such concerns before negotiating a SaaS deal with a customer. Establishing a playbook will enable the vendor to close customer SaaS deals with greater efficiency and achieve more consistent deal terms across its customer base.
In closing, the best approach for software vendors contemplating migrating to a SaaS business model is to first understand how SaaS deals differ from on-premise software license arrangements, and then, to amend their customer agreement accordingly in order to capture the full scope of a SaaS arrangement.

But what does that mean for your SaaS company? And how can you ensure you're meeting the necessary legal requirements?
In this article, we'll explore the key legal issues that SaaS companies need to be aware of, from data protection and privacy to contracts and intellectual property. We'll also provide practical tips and advice on how to navigate the complex world of SaaS law, from hiring a lawyer to creating a compliance program.
Whether you're a seasoned SaaS entrepreneur or just starting out, this guide is designed to help you understand the legal landscape and ensure your business is compliant with the latest regulations.
**Key Takeaways:**
  * Data protection and privacy are critical concerns for SaaS companies.

  * Staying up-to-date with the latest regulations is crucial for SaaS companies.
So, let's dive in and explore the world of SaaS law.
## Data Protection and Privacy
Data protection and privacy are critical concerns for SaaS companies, particularly in the wake of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). As a SaaS company, you're likely handling sensitive customer data, including personal information, financial data, and more. It's essential to ensure you're protecting this data and complying with relevant regulations.
To do this, you'll need to implement robust data protection measures, including:
    * Data encryption
    * Access controls
    * Data backup and recovery
    * Regular security audits
You'll also need to ensure you're complying with relevant privacy regulations, including the GDPR and CCPA. This means providing clear information to customers about how you're using their data, giving them the right to access and delete their data, and ensuring you're not sharing their data with third parties without their consent.
## Contracts and Intellectual Property
Contracts and intellectual property are essential for protecting your business. As a SaaS company, you'll need to ensure you're protecting your intellectual property, including your software code, trademarks, and more. You'll also need to ensure you're complying with relevant contract laws, including those related to licensing and distribution.
To do this, you'll need to:
      * Register your trademarks and patents
      * Develop a robust contract management system
      * Ensure you're complying with relevant contract laws
      * Protect your intellectual property through copyright and trademark law
## Hiring a Lawyer and Creating a Compliance Program
Hiring a lawyer and creating a compliance program are essential steps for ensuring legal compliance. As a SaaS company, you'll need to ensure you're complying with relevant regulations, including those related to data protection, privacy, and intellectual property.
To do this, you'll need to:
        * Hire a lawyer with experience in SaaS law
        * Create a compliance program that outlines your company's policies and procedures
        * Ensure you're complying with relevant regulations
        * Regularly review and update your compliance program
## Staying Up-to-Date with the Latest Regulations
Staying up-to-date with the latest regulations is crucial for SaaS companies. As a SaaS company, you'll need to ensure you're complying with relevant regulations, including those related to data protection, privacy, and intellectual property.
To do this, you'll need to:
          * Stay informed about the latest regulations and updates
          * Regularly review and update your compliance program
          * Ensure you're complying with relevant regulations
          * Seek legal advice when necessary
By following these steps, you can ensure your SaaS company is compliant with the latest regulations and protected from legal risks.

Higher adoption of the cloud, digital transformation, and the unprecedented rise of AI and machine learning (ML) are just some of the things that helped Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies continue to expand in 2023.
Unsurprisingly, the sector is set to be worth [$197 billion](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.statista.com/statistics/505243/worldwide-software-as-a-service-revenue/>) by the end of the year and is expected to grow to $232 billion by the end of the next. And not for nothing: this year, VCs [poured almost half of their capital](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/dealroom.co/guides/saas>) into companies with SaaS business models.
As we gaze into the promising horizon of the future, it’s imperative to acknowledge potential challenges and risks facing the [insurance SaaS](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/industry/saas/>) industry in 2024. Persistent cybercrimes, [intellectual property](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/insurance-terms/definition/intellectual-property/>) litigation, and emerging regulations could pose obstacles to the sector’s advancement, underscoring the importance of conducting a comprehensive threat assessment for every SaaS startup. Delve into the top five legal risks confronting insurance SaaS enterprises in the upcoming year and explore effective strategies for mitigating them in an ever-evolving digital landscape.
## 1. Cybersecurity and Data Breaches
According to Gartner, security and risk management spending will increase [14%](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-09-28-gartner-forecasts-global-security-and-risk-management-spending-to-grow-14-percent-in-2024>) in 2024. The consulting giant has also named continuous threat exposure management (CTEM) one of its top 10 strategic technology trends for next year. And SaaS companies should take this news to heart. A recent report showed that [four out of five](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/thehackernews.com/2023/08/cisos-tout-saas-cybersecurity.html>) surveyed businesses identified cybersecurity incidents in the past year.
So, the industry’s expansion isn’t coming without the pains of heavy cybercrime. For companies, this means losing clients’ trust in their product, as thousands of sensitive information could be on the line with each breach. Plus, to top it all off, IBM has reported that the average cost of data breaches has gone up to [$4.45 million](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach?utm_content=SRCWW&p1=Search&p4=43700072379268622&p5=p&gclid=CjwKCAjwt52mBhB5EiwA05YKo-WfmgXi49eT5j1CVFg0v_lZXpie9QXE774HsPN-w7cE8mN3hhBz_RoCP8sQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds>) in 2023 — meaning they’re also the costliest scenarios for SaaS enterprises.
Given the cost and likelihood of cyberattacks, emerging companies must consider protecting against these consequences. [Cyber liability insurance](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/coverage/cyber-liability-insurance/>), for example, helps those in the SaaS industry in the case of third-party lawsuits stemming from cyberattacks and steps up in the aftermath of these events to support data restoration and cost reimbursement.
## 2. Intellectual Property Infringement
Software companies aren’t immune to copyright infringement. Take the case of [Google vs. Oracle](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf>) in 2021, where these two tech giants clashed when Oracle found thousands of lines of source code and Java programming language APIs in Google’s early version of the Android operating system. After two years of legal back and forth, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Google, alleging their use of Oracle’s API was fair.
While copyright litigations can cost [$278,000](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/guide-to-intellectual-property-litigation/>) on average, trademark lawsuits could cost $2 million. And in such a competitive market, full of emerging companies and numerous software innovations, the smallest slip could be considered an infringement and be contested in a court of law.
SaaS businesses must protect their software assets to avoid unintentional similarities or theft from competitors. One way to do this is by getting IP indemnity, a clause that protects businesses from infringement risks and providing cost reimbursement. This is one of the benefits of [IP insurance](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/coverage/intellectual-property-insurance/>), which protects a company’s property — from copyrighted codes to patented platform designs — and covers them in case of claims. In a sector with massive high-growth opportunities, one can never be too careful.
## 3. Service Interruptions and System Failures
Fortune recently reported that [cloud outages are increasing](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/fortune.com/europe/2023/06/07/cloud-outages-on-the-rise-tech-geopolitics-internet/>), citing Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud’s downtime earlier this year as some of the most prominent SaaS incidents so far in 2023. But why are they so important? Nowadays, several moving pieces in a business function through cloud-based SaaS services: its communication platform, software and even database service.
This dependence on providers also means downtime tends to be a costly affair — $365,000 per hour in 2023, to be exact. The same can be said about system failures, which could be software glitches, a code bug, or any error built directly into the SaaS system (which happens a lot after system updates). And, because systems can be unpredictable and human error is unavoidable, SaaS companies must equip themselves to deal with the aftermath of these events.
A crucial step for companies is including a limitation of liability clause in service agreements. That way, the SaaS provider protects itself from paying damages in specific situations, like power outages outside its control. For issues directly related to the service, companies seek help from insurance companies to alleviate the legal and financial burden of such incidents. [Business Interruption insurance](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/blog/startups-need-know-about-business-interruption-insurance/>) is a good place to start to get support in case of oversight or inadequate work lawsuits.
## 4. Compliance and Regulatory Changes
Nothing is certain except death, taxes, and regulatory changes. For SaaS companies, this is especially true since the industry deals with a myriad of financial, security, and data components that intertwine with other industries as well. So, businesses must stay on top of compliance trends to make the necessary changes in their product. This keeps them trustworthy to clients and in check with the law.
For example, just this year, American states like Virginia and Utah followed suit after California enforced GDPR-inspired laws — known for being wildly different and more strict than American laws. Although only five states have joined so far, some expect [more to join them soon](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/us-data-privacy-laws-enter-new-era-2023-2023-01-12/>). Such laws that mimic what the EU has been doing for years translate into more data privacy accountability from SaaS companies, giving data ownership back to individuals who can set boundaries on who and what personal data companies can see.
As a result, providers have to run different versions of their service depending on their region or make massive shifts to accommodate a global scale.
But this is just the tip of the iceberg. SaaS companies must become chameleons that easily and quickly adapt to these changes, from software tweaks to internal policies and terms and conditions updates to clients. Ticking all compliance and regulatory boxes is a priority for an industry that keeps expanding, innovating, and [widely relying on venture capital](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/techcrunch.com/2023/06/29/why-does-it-seem-like-every-startup-is-a-saas-company/>) to become successful.
In trying to meet these new demands, businesses are better off appointing a Chief [Compliance Officer](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/blog/risk-management/>) (CCO) who solely focuses on the hurdles of the area. In this role, the one in charge will be monitoring industry changes, communicating with every department about new modifications and successfully enforcing them in the company.
On the other hand, companies can get extra help by acquiring insurance that covers regulatory fines and penalties — often through [Directors and Officers](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/coverage/directors-and-officers-insurance/>) insurance. Doing so often mitigates the heavy burden of the financial losses that come with such penalties. To ensure businesses are getting the right coverage, insurers assess the [insurability of fines and penalties](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/insurance-terms/definition/insurability-of-fines-and-penalties/>) depending on industry specificities, like being a provider of legal software, communications software, database storage, etc.
## 5. Contractual Liabilities
When selling their services, SaaS companies must draft a contract outlining their rights and responsibilities as a vendor. And much like service interruptions and systems failures, it’s impossible to predict when things will go wrong and cause a breach of these terms. For example, SaaS agreements usually include a Service Level Agreement (SLA) informing of the service’s minimum performance standard to assure customers that downtime will seldom happen — where the minimum is [99.9%](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/Negotiate-a-SaaS-SLA-for-compliance-uptime-considerations>).
Data privacy and ownership, payments, and cybersecurity are also included in SaaS agreements, outlining how the provider handles customer data, how, when and what amount the client will pay and safety measures against cyberattacks. However, extensive outages, data leaks, and many other unprecedented issues that result in breach of contract might put SaaS companies in legal hurdles.
If an indemnity clause isn’t included, exempting the provider from legal responsibility in certain situations, then clients have grounds to sue the company for the damages caused. And, as discussed in previous scenarios, data breaches and service interruptions can be costly for SaaS companies.
To further protect themselves from financial and legal losses, companies can seek a [Contractual Liability Insurance Policy](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/insurance-terms/definition/contractual-liability-insurance-policy-clip/>) (CLIP), which acts as a safety net whenever they need to fulfill their responsibilities for a breach of contract, mitigating any financial impacts.
## Emerging Risks: The Unknowns of 2024
2024 looks like a [promising year](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.saastr.com/the-second-half-of-2023-could-be-really-good-for-saas/>) for the SaaS industry: A few companies are set to go the [Initial Public Offering](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/raising-capital/ipo-roadmap/>) (IPO) route and inflation is decreasing while interest rates reach their peak and die down. Plus, after such a tough 2023, things can only look up, right?
However, this ever-evolving market can quickly become chaotic and difficult to pin down, and that’s where risks arise. To start, next year, companies like [Unicommerce](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/news-and-trends/e-commerce-saas-company-unicommerce-eyes-public-listing-in/465637>) and [Databricks](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.saastr.com/the-second-half-of-2023-could-be-really-good-for-saas/>) have the chance to IPO. While this can help reactivate VC investments, going public can also bring its own set of risks — like post-acquisition litigation.
On the other hand, a recent report shows that [sales cycles](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.crowdfundinsider.com/2023/10/212752-saas-market-in-a-downward-trend-with-founders-investors-experiencing-the-impact-capchase-report-claims/>) have become longer for SaaS businesses in 2023, and it seems like an upward trend into the coming year, with the biggest issue being payment bottlenecks. A lack of flexible payment options has stalled contract creation, the report cites, with contract values decreasing as well.
Lastly, as [AI takes center stage](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/www.techrepublic.com/article/gartners-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2024/>) in the tech sector, we might see more copyright and data privacy cases stemming from generative AI usage in the industry. SaaS companies must heavily monitor their usage of this technology with trust, risk, and security management strategies to ensure they stay compliant in the IP and data safety departments.
## Key Components for Successful Risk Mitigation
With these evident risks posing threats in 2024, it’s undeniable that SaaS companies need the most support they can get to ensure continued business success. So, to stay compliant, safe, accountable, and operational, leaders must constantly run assessments with each department (IT, accounting, compliance, and so on) to identify potential threats and growth opportunities.
Furthermore, [SaaS insurance](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/business-insurance/saas/>) is a necessary tool for businesses to weather any storm, be it legal or financial. Alongside insurance experts, companies can identify their weak spots and growth areas that need the most protection, creating specialized coverage tailored to the potential and evolving risks of the business’ adjacent industries.
## New Year, New Opportunities
As we head into another promising year for the SaaS industry, it’s important to keep detractors like cybersecurity, IP infringement, service downtime, regulations and compliance, [consulting risks](https://foundershield.com/blog/legal-risks-for-saas-companies/<https:/foundershield.com/blog/risks-consulting-firms/>), and contractual liabilities in mind to run into as little disruption as possible.
Also, remember to have constant conversations with your insurance brokers so your protection is as updated as possible, reducing risks to a minimum in a landscape where threats evolve by the minute.
At Founder Shield, we know that for SaaS, cyberattacks make up some of the industry’s biggest headaches. So, start your 2024 by knowing the best cyber risk management strategies to protect your company and ensure its success.
