# Online Python IDE
Build, run, and share Python code online for free with the help of online-integrated python's development environment (IDE). It is one of the most efficient, dependable, and potent online compilers for the Python programming language. It is not necessary for you to bother about establishing a Python environment in your local. Now You can immediately execute the Python code in the web browser of your choice. Using this Python editor is simple and quick to get up and running with. Simply type in the programme, and then press the **RUN** button! The code can be saved online by choosing the **SHARE** option, which also gives you the ability to access your code from any location providing you have internet access.
## About Python
Python, which was initially developed by Guido van Rossum and made available to the public in 1991, is currently one of the most widely used general-purpose programming languages. Python's source code is freely available to the public, and its usage and distribution are unrestricted, including for commercial purposes. It is widely used for web development, and using it, practically anything can be created, including mobile apps, online apps, tools, data analytics, machine learning, and so on. It is intended to be straightforward and uncomplicated, much like the English language. When compared to other programming languages such as C++, Java, and C#, it is a lot simpler to read and write Python programs. Because of its excellent productivity and efficiency, it has become a very popular choice for use as a programming language.

## Why Learn Python?
  * Python is a simple language to pick up. It has a simple syntax, and the code is quite easy to read.
  * Python is useful in a wide variety of contexts. It is put to use in the creation of quick application development, data science, Internet of Things, and web applications, among other things.
  * When compared to most other programming languages, it enables you to develop applications using a smaller number of lines of code.
  * It has a very huge community behind it, and there are active forums for users to participate in.
  * The presence of Third Party Modules contributes to the increased power of the Python programming language.
  * The user is able to easily solve difficult problems with the help of extensive support libraries (for example, NumPy, which is used for numerical computations and Pandas, which is used for data analytics).
  * It includes extremely user-friendly data structures, which simplify both the design of the code and the reasoning behind it.
  * The number of people using Python is constantly on the rise. It has quickly become one of the most widely used programming languages.
