# Google Search Scraper Agent with LLM Integration

### Overview

Google Search Scraper Agent is a powerful and flexible tool designed to automate the process of scraping Google search results across multiple pages, extracting detailed content from each linked webpage, and processing the gathered data using a Language Model (LLM). Leveraging modern Python libraries such as httpx, BeautifulSoup, and pydantic_ai, this agent streamlines data collection for research, analysis, and various other applications.

Features
	•	Multi-Page Scraping: Automatically navigate through up to 5 pages of Google search results to gather comprehensive data.
	•	Individual Page Scraping: For each search result, the agent visits the linked webpage to extract detailed content.
	•	Structured Data Storage: Utilizes Pydantic models to organize and validate scraped data, ensuring consistency and reliability.
	•	LLM Integration: Processes extracted content using a Language Model (e.g., groq:llama3-70b-8192) to generate summaries or extract key information.
	•	Error Handling: Robust mechanisms to gracefully handle HTTP errors, connection issues, and unexpected webpage structures.
	•	Synchronous Execution: Simplifies the scraping process by executing tasks synchronously, making it easy to understand and debug.

Installation

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.8 or higher: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.
	•	Git: To clone the repository. Download from git-scm.com.

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-search-scraper-agent.git
cd google-search-scraper-agent

Create a Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not provided, you can install the necessary packages manually:

pip install httpx beautifulsoup4 pydantic pydantic_ai

Usage

Basic Execution

Run the scraper script to perform a Google search, scrape results, and process the content.

python scraper.py

Custom Query

To perform a search with a custom query, modify the query variable in the main() function of scraper.py:

def main():
    query = "Your custom search query here"
    ...

Configuration

Model Selection

The agent is configured to use the groq:llama3-70b-8192 Language Model. Ensure that you have access to this model or replace it with a compatible LLM available in your environment.

agent = Agent(
    model="groq:llama3-70b-8192",
    tools=[scrape_google],
    result_type=ScrapeResult
)

Adjusting Number of Pages

By default, the agent scrapes up to 5 pages of Google search results (totaling 50 results). You can adjust this by modifying the num_pages parameter in the ScrapeQuery model.

class ScrapeQuery(BaseModel):
    query: str
    num_pages: int = 5  # Change this value as needed
